Rating: REDUCE | CMP: Rs5,397 | TP: Rs5,300 Q2FY24 Result Update \\u2013 In line EBITDA aided by gRevlimid and PLI incentives Quick Pointers: \\u00a7 Margins came in at 26.6%; down 270 bps QoQ adjusted for PLI incentives. \\u00a7 India formulation grew in high single digit, adj for divestment and NLEM. We increase our FY24/25E EPS estimates by 13.5%/7.6% aided by higher gRevlimid sales, however base business profitability continues to remain moderate. Dr. Reddy\\u2019s (DRRD) Q2FY24 EBITDA was largely in-line with our estimate, while base business margins ex of Revlimid and PLI incentives continued to remain muted below ~19-20%. Further thin US pipeline in near term remains a key risk. At CMP, DRRD is trading at expensive valuations of 24x P/E on FY25E adjusted for gRevlimid. We maintain our \\u2018Reduce\\u2019 rating with revised TP of Rs5,300/share (Rs5,150 earlier) as we roll forward; valuing at 23x Sept 2025E EPS for base business. Any big ticket ANDA approvals and sharp recovery in base business margins are key risks to our call. \\u00a7 Revenue growth aided by US generics: DRRD\\u2019s sales grew by 9% YoY at Rs 69bn; largely in-line with our estimate. The growth momentum continued, mainly by gRevlimid sales. US revenue came in at $384mn ($389mn in Q1FY24) vs our est of $380mn. Domestic business adjusted for divestment and NLEM price impact grew in high single digit. PSAI sales grew by 9% YoY. EU increased 26% YoY, while Russia sales declined by 2% YoY. \\u00a7 EBIDTA adjusted for PLI incentives came lower than est: DRRD reported EBIDTA at Rs 20bn; Adj for PLI incentives; EBITDA came in at Rs18.3bn; down 7% QoQ. Ex Revlimid and PLI incentives, we believe EBITDA came in at Rs9-10bn. Adj OPM for PLI incentives came in at 26.6% down 270bps QoQ, we est 29%. Segment wise PSAI margins were at 17.8% (15% in Q1FY24) and generic margins were at 63.6% (63.9% in Q1FY24). \\u00a7 Key concall takeaways: (1) US business: Filed 2 and launched 4 ANDAs in US during quarter. Guided for 25-30 new launches in FY24. The price erosion in this quarter was in single digits. Q2FY24 sales was aided by market share expansion in core portfolio and integration of Mayne acquisition. On gNuvaring market share should ramp up in coming quarters (2) Biosimilars: Overall 20-25% of R&D spend is towards biosimilar. Expect first wave of launch from FY27. Filed for Rituximab and may launch in FY25 (3) Domestic business: Mgt expects to beat the IPM growth going ahead. Chronic therapies contribute 35% of the India business. Will be partnering with innovators and have closed 10 such licensing deals with focus areas like Cardiovascular, Diabetic, CNS, and Oncology (4) Europe: Base volumes and growth from injectables and tender wins supported performance. Launched 20 products (5) Russia business declined YoY due to currency devaluation. The YoY growth in CIS and EM sales was on account of price increases. (6) PSAI: Growth was largely due to new launches. Profitability to improve as volume picks up. (7) Company expects growth to accelerate in China as approvals are picking up (8) Tax rate likely to be in range of 24-25% (9) PLI incentives to be higher for FY24.

Ethereum, on the other hand, saw a high of $1,852.53 (October 26) and a low of $1,665.73 (October 23). Crypto Events To Note In recent developments within the cryptocurrency investment space, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and VanEck Bitcoin Trust have made significant strides. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, introduced to the market in October 2021, is designed to generate returns mirroring those of Bitcoin by engaging in Bitcoin futures contracts. Notably, the Fund does not make direct investments in bitcoin itself. As of the latest data, the ETF has displayed an impressive 80 per cent year-to-date increase in performance, but it's worth noting that it has also seen a 36 per cent decline since its inception. On October 27, VanEck took a significant step by submitting a preliminary prospectus for the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This ETF is structured with the primary goal of replicating bitcoin's performance, less operating expenses, by directly holding bitcoin. According to information provided in the preliminary prospectus, the custody of all Bitcoin holdings on behalf of the Trust will be entrusted to Gemini Trust Company LLC. These developments reflect the ongoing evolution and diversification of investment options in the cryptocurrency market, as investors seek new ways to gain exposure to digital assets while managing associated risks. In a recent cryptocurrency market update, CoinDesk reported that Bitcoin (BTC) has exhibited a notable surge in its bullish momentum. Over a week, BTC witnessed a remarkable gain of over 14 per cent, ultimately stabilising at approximately $33,700. This surge followed Bitcoin's recent attainment of its annual peak at $35,000, albeit falling short of breaking through that crucial price level. It is worth noting that Bitcoin's performance closely mirrors the 14 per cent increase recorded in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI). Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market displayed notable strength in the CoinDesk Computing Sector (CPU), which is an index designed to monitor protocols dedicated to establishing and supporting the infrastructure for Web3 and distributed computing. The CPU index observed substantial growth of over 17 per cent, primarily driven by the impressive performance of tokens such as Chainlink (LINK) and Fetch.AI (FET). These gains in the computing sector underline the growing interest in projects related to the development of Web3 and distributed computing systems within the cryptocurrency landscape. Lastly, as reported by CNBC, Zodia Custody, a crypto security company under the ownership of the renowned British banking giant Standard Chartered, has disclosed its forthcoming launch of services in Hong Kong. This development signifies the latest strategic expansion move by the United Kingdom-based firm into the Asia-Pacific region. Zodia Custody, established in 2020, specialises in providing secure cryptocurrency storage solutions to financial institutions. Julian Sawyer, the CEO of Zodia, emphasised that the Hong Kong market exhibits a unique demand profile, primarily stemming from institutional entities rather than individual retail customers. He asserted that such institutional demand aligns seamlessly with Zodia's service offerings. Julian Sawyer also highlighted the proactive stance of the Hong Kong government and regulatory bodies in recognising the significance of digital assets in shaping the future financial landscape. They aspire to position Hong Kong as a central hub for the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.

Clarifying the group's position, they said Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and GAIL (India) Ltd have hired capacity on the newly built terminal at rates lower than a similar but older and depreciated facility at Dahej in Gujarat. This came in response to reported comments by Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, who is facing a Lok Sabha Ethics Committee examination over cash for query in Parliament, on Dhamra being built on financial backing and commitments to buy gas at a fixed price. The project cost of Dhamra LNG terminal is Rs 6,450 crore, the sources said responding to Moitra's assertion that the terminal to import natural gas in its liquid form, called LNG, was built at a much higher cost than Rs 5,000 crore that IOC incurred in construction of a similar sized facility at Ennore in Tamil Nadu. Sources said no amount upfront or during the project either as cash or bank guarantee has been given by IOC and GAIL. The project is fully financed by equity and debt by shareholders of Dhamra LNG terminal, they said, rejecting the assertion that IOC and GAIL paid Rs 46,500 crore. IOC had in 2015 signed to use up to 60 per cent of the terminal's 5 million tonnes a year capacity for importing gas for its refineries at Haldia in West Bengal and Paradip in Odisha. GAIL too had signed up for 1.5 million tonnes of the terminal's regasification capacity. Sources asserted that its tariff and commercial terms of Dhamra LNG terminal (inclusive of port charges) was arrived at through competitive benchmarking. Petronet LNG (which is owned by IOC, GAIL, BPCL and ONGC) operates India's largest LNG terminal at Dahej was used as benchmarking the tariff and commercial terms, they said. Dhamra tariff is 1.5 per cent lower (Rs 46.49 per ton or Rs 21 crore annually over 4.5 million tonnes of LNG capacity use) than Dahej LNG terminal charges and has better commercial terms as well. Moitra had, however, compared the tariff of Dhamra with Ennore, which was commissioned not so long back. This charge compares to Rs 57.38 per mmBtu regasification charges for Ennore LNG terminal, he had said. Originally, IOC and GAIL had on September 21, 2016, signed a 'non-binding' agreement to buy a 50 per cent stake in Adani Group's Rs 5,500-crore Dhamra LNG project in Odisha. But that agreement expired on September 20, 2018, without being translated into a firm pact apparently because of differences over valuation. Sources said IOC and GAIL import LNG on their own and only pay tolling charges. Dhamra LNG will not buy and sell LNG during the operations of the facility. It only provides the service of LNG handling and dispatch, they said, rejecting the claim of a 20-year fixed payment by IOC and GAIL to Adani for gas. On a charge that businessman Darshan Hiranandani posed questions on Adani Group using Moitra's parliamentary logins as his business was impacted because of IOC and GAIL committing to Dhamra, sources said Hiranandani's H-Energy had obtained a NOC from the Kolkata Port Trust to set up a LNG terminal in Kukrahati in February 2020. Though this NOC is still valid, they have been unsuccessful in progressing the same. This terminal of H-Energy would cater to the same catchment area being serviced by Dhamra LNG, they said. H-Energy was also looking at IOC and GAIL to book capacity for their terminal. However, they were unable to justify a value proposition to IOC and GAIL that was better than what was being offered at Dhamra LNG terminal. This stymied their efforts to develop this facility, sources claimed. On IOC and GAIL not taking equity in Dhamra, they said the LNG terminal was able to offer commercially competitive terms to the users and given the pipeline tariff competitiveness of supplying nearby consumption centres, IOC and GAIL were confident of bringing LNG at the cheapest terms via Dhamra to their consumption centres. Hence, their strategic objective was met without injecting equity and they decided to progress on a capacity booking basis only. The strong credentials of the project developers and the significant amount of pre-investment undertaken by Adani gave further confidence to IOC and GAIL on project completion, they added.\\\\xa0 (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.
