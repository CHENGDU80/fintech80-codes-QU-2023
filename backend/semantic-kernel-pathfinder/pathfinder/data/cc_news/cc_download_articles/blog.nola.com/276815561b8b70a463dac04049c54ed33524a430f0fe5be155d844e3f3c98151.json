    "maintext": "At the start of hurricane season, Levees.org is releasing its latest Myth Buster in a new video.\nThe Myth Buster video aims to dispel a stubborn myth - that local people in New Orleans are responsible for the levee failures during Hurricane Katrina.\nFACT: Levee maintenance by local people had nothing to do with the levee failures in New Orleans thirteen years ago.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers has testified before Congress that the pre-Katrina levee boards received grades of \"outstanding\" for their levee maintenance for over 50 years.\nIn the post Katrina confusion, the levee boards were punished and then reorganized.\nLevees.org discovered in a FOIA request that - for the past decade - the Army Corps gave the new Levee Authorities grades of \"minimally acceptable\" for their levee maintenance inspections every year.\nBottom line: Levees and floodwalls failed during Katrina due to design errors by the federal Army Corps. Not bad levee maintenance by local people.",
