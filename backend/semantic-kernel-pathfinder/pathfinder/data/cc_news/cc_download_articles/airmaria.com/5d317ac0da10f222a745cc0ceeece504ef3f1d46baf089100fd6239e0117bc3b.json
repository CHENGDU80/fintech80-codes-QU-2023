    "maintext": "Ave Maria!At the Saint Paul Street Evangelization 2017 retreat for Evangelists called Lumen Veritatis at the Mother of the Redeemer Retreat Center , Fr. Ignatius Manfredonia gives the first of six talks: \"How to get to Heaven.\" He answers the question, \"Is it difficult or easy to get to Heaven?\" Getting to Heaven seems so complicated - faith, the sacraments, justification, good works, grace, merit, purgatory, indulgences.
