I saw the people getting into the ambulance,\" one witness told CTV News. \"There were so many fire trucks… it was scary.\"\nPolice said multiple calls were made to 911 reporting a black Dodge pickup truck driving erratically before the crash. Early investigation suggested the driver left a parking stall, backed into a parked vehicle, then drove forward into the drive-thru lane, colliding with the barricades.\nThe driver then jumped the curb and came to a stop against an empty bus shelter.\nA female pedestrian and her son were injured in the series of events, and both were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\nMounties said a 34-year-old Mission, B.C. man was arrested at the scene for investigation of impaired driving, hit-and-run and dangerous driving causing bodily harm. He was released on a promise to appear in court.",
