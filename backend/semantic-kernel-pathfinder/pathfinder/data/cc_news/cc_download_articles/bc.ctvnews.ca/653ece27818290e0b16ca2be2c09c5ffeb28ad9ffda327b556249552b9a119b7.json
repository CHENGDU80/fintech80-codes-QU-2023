    "maintext": "CTV Vancouver\nThree of the youths accused of killing 19-year-old Luka Gordic in Whistler are expected to learn their fates Friday morning.\nVerdicts for the young men, who canâ€™t be named because they were underage at the time of the attack, expected to be delivered in B.C. Supreme Court after 10 a.m.\nOne is charged with second-degree murder, while the other two are charged with manslaughter.\nThe victim, a resident of Burnaby, was swarmed and assaulted by as many as 15 people over the 2015 Victoria Day long weekend. The court heard Gordic was punched, kicked, and stabbed in the heart with a knife.\nOne of his attackers, Arvin Golic, was charged with second-degree murder but convicted on the lesser charge of manslaughter back in June.\nThe court heard Golic, who was 18 at the time, did not deliver the fatal blow but did organize the beating after Gordic stood up for a young woman they both knew.\nWith files from CTV Vancouver's Nafeesa Karim",
