    "maintext": "The Canadian Press\nVICTORIA - British Columbia's Conservation Officer Service reports more than 20,000 conflicts between humans and wildlife around the province between January and October of this year.\nEnvironment Ministry spokesman Mike Badry says about 14,000 of those complaints involve confrontations with black bears.\nHe says 469 bruins, or approximately one bear in every 30 complaints, had to be destroyed.\nSpring and early summer produced the greatest number of complaints about bears, but Badry says the confrontations have tailed off, making 2017 an average year for complaints about wildlife.\nHe warns that confrontations could increase because bears are now focused on finding as much food as possible before they hibernate.\nHomeowners are urged to secure all food sources, such as garbage or compost and to ensure fruit trees are picked clean.",
