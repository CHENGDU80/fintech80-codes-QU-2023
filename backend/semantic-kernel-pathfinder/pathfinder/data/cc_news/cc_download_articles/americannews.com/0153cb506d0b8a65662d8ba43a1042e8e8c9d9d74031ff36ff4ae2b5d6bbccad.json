    "maintext": "America was in a state of unrest after watching white supremacists violently protest in Charlottesville, Virginia leaving three people dead and dozens injured.\nIt did not take long for the masses to link President Donald Trump to white supremacists. They even berated him more because he didn’t use harsh enough language to condemn the white supremacists.\nThis photo of our President eventually went viral:\nRaf Sanchez, a Telegraph reporter, posted this caption along with the picture, “Here’s a photo of @Millenial_Matt with Trump and carrying a burning torch in Charlottesville. This isn’t complicated.”\nThe tweet received over 25,000 tweets, but unfortunately hours later the tweet was deleted because it turns out the photo was actually a fake.\nIt appears @millenial_matt's profile picture is photoshopped. Here's the original Trump picture. pic.twitter.com/OClcOFbZ2w — Raf Sanchez (@rafsanchez) August 13, 2017\nSanchez did not retract his belief that “many Nazis in Charlottesville were Trump supporters”:\nPresident Trump responded with this statement:\nOf course, the President was referring to white supremacists as we found out later when a White House spokesperson clarified this information.",
