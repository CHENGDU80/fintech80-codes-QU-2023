    "maintext": "In the past few months, we have seen liberals stoop to unprecedented lows in an effort to destroy Donald Trump. They have even\nresorted to attacking his 11-year-old son Barron.\nNow, a petition has gone viral demanding that Barron and his mother Melania Trump move to the White House and leave New\nYork City immediately. Of course, the Trumps have made it clear that they will move to Washington D.C. in June, after Barron\nwraps up his schooling.\n“The U.S. taxpayer is paying an exorbitant amount of money to protect the First Lady in Trump Tower, located in New York City,”\nthe petition reads. “As to help relieve the national debt, this expense yields no positive results for the nation and should be cut\nfrom being funded.”\nThe petition has already garnered more than 400,000 signatures.\n“U.S. House of Representatives: Make Melania Trump stay in the White House or pay for expenses herself,” one petitioner signer\nwrote.\n“If she chooses to live apart from her husband, the American Tax Payers should NOT pick up the tab,” another added.\nWhat do you think? Is this petition absolutely absurd?",
