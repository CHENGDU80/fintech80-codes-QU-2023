    "maintext": "After a white supremacist event “Unite the Right” turned deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend, intense discussions about race have sparked all over social media. Twitter and Facebook feeds have been filled with comments and discussions of people trying to figure out how the violent events over the weekend transpired, as well as how we can prevent them in the future.\nThings got a little heated on CNN when host Chris Cuomo welcomed former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and contributor Symone sanders onto the network to discuss the march and Trump’s response.\nThings did not go as planned from the beginning.\nSanders was upset and kept interrupting Cuccinelli because he was insisting that the stature of Robert E. Lee was a justification for bringing these various racist groups together. Finally, when he could not handle it anymore, he retaliated:\nSymone continues in the fight:\nCuomo felt the need to intervene once it was obvious the two were about to engage in battle.\nWatch the video to see these two go at it for practically 10 minutes.",
