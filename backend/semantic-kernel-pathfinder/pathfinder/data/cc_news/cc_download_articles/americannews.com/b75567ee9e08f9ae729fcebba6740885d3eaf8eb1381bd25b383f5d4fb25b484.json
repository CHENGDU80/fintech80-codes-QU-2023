    "maintext": "This week, Neil Gorsuch made his first ruling as a Supreme Court justice—and we can guarantee that Barack Obama isn’t going\nto like it.\nAccording to reports from TruthMonitor, the Supreme Court made the controversial decision that the only Islam taught to our\nchildren in public schools will be the history of Radical Islam. Gorsuch cast the deciding vote in the case, as the final ruling as 5-4.\n“The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue,”\nGorsuch said in a statement about his decision.\n“This is about the Judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion,” he continued. “We should be\nteaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be\nfilling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”\n“It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated,” he concluded.\nWhat do you think? Do you agree with Gorsuch’s decision?",
