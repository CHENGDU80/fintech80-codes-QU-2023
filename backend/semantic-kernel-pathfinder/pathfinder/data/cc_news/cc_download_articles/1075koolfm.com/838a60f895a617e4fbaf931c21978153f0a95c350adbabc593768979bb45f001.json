    "maintext": "Bradford is mulling over red light cameras. At it’s latest meeting, council voted to have staff look at the feasibility of implementing a red light program in town. The town’s traffic department will crunch the numbers and report back if its worth the cost. Barrie went through a similar exercise last year, ending after the city’s Police Chief pointed out fewer than 4 per cent of collisions occur in Barrie because of running red lights.",
