It's burning across parts of Yolo and Napa counties, east of Lake Berryessa.\"Crews are taking advance of favorable weather conditions and conducting a firing operation\", said Jordan Motta, a fire captain and Cal Fire spokesman.Motta says crews are using special equipment, including drip torches and pistols to fight the fire. The department posted a video on its Twitter page to explain.\"What they'll be using is drip torches and pistols, which shoot a firing device, to help us take away fuel from the main fire,\" said Motta. \"That allows us to burn in a more controlled fashion.\"Cal Fire says this special firing operation will continue as long as conditions allow.
