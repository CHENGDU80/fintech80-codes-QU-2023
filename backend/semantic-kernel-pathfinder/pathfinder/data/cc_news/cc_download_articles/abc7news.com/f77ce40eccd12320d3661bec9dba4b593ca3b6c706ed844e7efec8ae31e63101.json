He was assigned to the Point Reyes substation.Marin County Sheriff Robert Doyle said someone called 911 to report signs of a traffic accident and then hung up.Doyle said Zirkle had not been heard from for several minutes so his partner was dispatched to investigate and discovered the crash.First-responders needed 35 minutes to remove Zirkle from his vehicle. He was flown to Petaluma Valley Hospital where he died.Doyle said Zirkle grew up and attended schools in Novato and attended Sacramento State University.He was described as a happy, enthusiastic, positive man who wanted to serve the community.Zirkle's fianc√©e was out of town at the time of the crash and her father returned her to Marin County. Zirkle recently bought her a home in Petaluma, Doyle said.",
