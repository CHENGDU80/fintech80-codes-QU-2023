It's coaching,\" Calhoun told the Courant.\nCalhoun retired in 2012 after spending 26 seasons at UConn and coaching the Huskies to three NCAA championships. The Hall of Famer told the Courant that he misses interacting with players.\n\"That's what I miss, people getting together, getting on a bus, driving someplace. I'm not sure what I want to yet,\" Calhoun said. \"I do want to do some basketball stuff if I can.\"",
