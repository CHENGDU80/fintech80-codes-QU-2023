    "maintext": "The perfect pool accessory is here and just in time to make a splash this summer!\nBark Shop and Funboy have teamed up to create matching inflatable rafts specifically designed for dog owners and their pups.\nCourtesy BARK Shop\nThe adorable rafts come in two styles, a pink convertible and a white yacht with a gold racing stripe, and are $59 each.\nEach dog float features thick \"puncture resistant material and a reinforced compartment for treats or toys,\" according to Bark Shop.\nCourtesy BARK Shop\nOne reviewer who shared a photo of her Maltipoo lounging on the white yacht said she got the float for trips to the lake. The dogs will go in \"but donâ€™t really like the water,\" she said.\n\"This float is the winner - great quality and the boys were actually able to lay down and relax even when it was quite wavy,\" she added.\nCourtesy BARK Shop\nThe dog-sized pool lounger can hold up to 70 pounds, so it's best-suited for small- to medium-furry friends.",
