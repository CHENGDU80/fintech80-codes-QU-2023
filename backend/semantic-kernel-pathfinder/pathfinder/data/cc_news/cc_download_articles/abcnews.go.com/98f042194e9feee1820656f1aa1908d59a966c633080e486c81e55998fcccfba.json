    "maintext": "A former NFL agent has pleaded guilty to violating North Carolina's sports agent law by providing thousands of dollars in improper benefits to three former Tar Heels football players to entice them into signing contracts with him.\nTerry Watson entered his plea Monday afternoon in a deal to resolve 3 ?-year-old felony charges. Watson received 30 months of probation and a $5,000 fine, while Judge Graham Shirley issued a suspended jail sentence of six to eight months.\nWatson pleaded guilty to the 13 counts of athlete-agent inducement for providing roughly $24,000 in cash and travel accommodations to eventual NFL players Robert Quinn, Marvin Austin and Greg Little. A felony obstruction of justice charge for not providing records sought by authorities was dismissed as part of the deal.\n———\nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org\n———\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap",
