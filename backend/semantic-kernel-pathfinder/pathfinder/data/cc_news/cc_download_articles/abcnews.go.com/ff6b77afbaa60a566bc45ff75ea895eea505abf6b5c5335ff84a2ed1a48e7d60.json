    "maintext": "A natural gas pipeline has exploded in South Texas, in a fiery display that lit up the sky and could be seen for miles.\nTexas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Nathan Brandley says the explosion occurred early Wednesday near Refugio (ray-FYOO'-ee-oh), a rural community north of Corpus Christi, about 15 miles from the Texas Coast.\nBrandley says no one was hurt and that there are no refineries or plants nearby.\nHe says it's too early to know what triggered the explosion.\nBrandley says crews are working to close the line and extinguish the flames.\nMishaps with transmission lines are not uncommon. In the past two decades, the U.S. government has recorded more than 2,000 accidents on gas transmission lines across the country.",
