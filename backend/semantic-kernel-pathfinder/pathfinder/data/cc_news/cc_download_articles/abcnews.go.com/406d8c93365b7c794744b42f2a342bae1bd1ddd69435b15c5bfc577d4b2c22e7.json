Work by German construction company Julius Berger will continue after the airport reopens and is expected to take six months.\nFlights would be diverted for six weeks to Kaduna city, which is 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Abuja on a road frequented by bandits.\nA government statement Monday says officials will meet stakeholders on Thursday, realizing the \"high level of discomfort and inconvenience\" the closure of one of West Africa's busiest airports will cause.",
