    "maintext": "A Kansas City attorney has been acquitted in the killing of her millionaire father and his girlfriend at their Missouri lake house.\nThe Kansas City Star ( http://bit.ly/2kx1VdE ) reports that jurors found Susan \"Liz\" Van Note not guilty Tuesday of two counts of first-degree murder in the 2010 attack on 67-year-old William Van Note and 59-year-old Sharon Dickson.\nDickson was stabbed and shot at the Lake of the Ozarks house and died at the scene.\nWilliam Van Note died four days later at a hospital, where authorities say his daughter produced a document suggesting she had power of attorney. Investigators say she requested that the ventilator keeping him alive be shut off.\nAuthorities allege Van Note was in debt and angry that Dickson would have inherited the bulk of her father's estate.\n———\nInformation from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com",
