    "maintext": "Harvard University is teaming up with Google to reduce the use of harmful chemicals in building products and materials.\nOrganizers say the initiative announced Wednesday targets chemicals used in consumer products like furniture and carpets that science has shown have potential negative health effects.\nThe goal is to create a set of tools using the latest research to inform decisions by large institutions, purchasers and manufacturers with the hope of increasing demand for healthier alternatives. Organizers said there are more than 80,000 chemicals in use, some associated with long-term health and environmental problems.\nThe collaboration is an initiative of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment launched Wednesday at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nThe center is led by former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy.",
