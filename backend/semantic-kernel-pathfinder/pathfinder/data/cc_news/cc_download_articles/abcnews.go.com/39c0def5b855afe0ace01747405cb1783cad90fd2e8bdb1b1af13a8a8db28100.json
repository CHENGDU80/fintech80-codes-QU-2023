Estes denies harassing Cagle and says the relationship was consensual.\nHoward Neff is executive director of the Commission on Judicial Conduct. He called Estes' behavior \"egregious.\"\nNeff told the court that an indefinite suspension would allow lawmakers to decide whether to remove Estes from the bench and restore public faith in the administration of justice.",
