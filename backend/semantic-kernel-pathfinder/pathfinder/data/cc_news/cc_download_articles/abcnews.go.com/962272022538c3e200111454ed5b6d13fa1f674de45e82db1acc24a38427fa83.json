    "maintext": "The winds aren't changing for Southern California's wildfires yet.\nThe fifth largest blaze in state history was threatening thousands of homes as it churned through coastal mountains amid persistently dangerous weather conditions.\nRed Flag warnings for fire danger due to Santa Ana winds and a critical lack of moisture were extended instead of expiring Monday afternoon as was initially forecast.\nThe National Weather Service tweeted, \"It doesn't get much drier than this,\" signaling that the dangerous fire conditions just aren't going away.\nThe wildfire has destroyed 683 homes and burned over 360 square miles of dry brush and timber.",
