    "maintext": "The government of Bermuda has sued a Massachusetts hospital, saying it bribed the island's former leader in order to secure business there.\nThe Boston Globe ( http://bit.ly/2l7GYrA ) reports that the federal suit filed Tuesday alleges that Lahey Hospital and Medical Center and Ewart Brown, a doctor who was Bermuda's premier from 2006 to 2010, were part of a racketeering conspiracy that spanned 20 years.\nThe suit alleges that in return for bribes disguised as consulting fees, Brown directed a large share of the island's health care business to Lahey, including lucrative contracts to interpret unnecessary MRIs and CT scans performed at two clinics owned by Brown.\nLahey said in a statement that the allegations are \"baseless and without merit.\"\nBermuda, a British territory, is seeking unspecified damages from Burlington-based Lahey.\n———\nInformation from: The Boston Globe, http://www.bostonglobe.com",
