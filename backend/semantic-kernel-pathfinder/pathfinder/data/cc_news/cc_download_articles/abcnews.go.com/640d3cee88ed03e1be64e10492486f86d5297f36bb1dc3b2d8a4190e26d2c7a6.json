    "maintext": "The mother of Utah man imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly 1? years is circulating a new audio recording of her son talking about how he's suffering without medical care.\nLaurie Holt said Monday that she's sharing the recording Joshua Holt sent by cellphone so people can hear how dire the situation is. She's calling on Venezuela to release him on humanitarian grounds.\nIn the short recording, he talks about throwing up all night, feeling dizzy and struggling to think.\nThe 25-year-old traveled to Venezuela in June 2016 to marry a woman. The couple was arrested at her family's Caracas apartment by police who alleged Holt was stockpiling weapons.\nTheir families say they're innocent.\nJoshua Holt has a hearing scheduled Tuesday in Caracas, but most of his previous hearings have been canceled.",
