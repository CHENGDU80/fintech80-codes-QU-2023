    "maintext": "A Baltimore school police officer caught on video slapping and kicking a teen at a school while another officer stood by has accepted a plea deal.\nNews media outlets report Anthony Spence entered an Alford plea on Tuesday to a second-degree assault charge, not admitting guilt, but acknowledging prosecutors have enough evidence to convict.\nInstead of facing jail time, Spence will get probation before judgment and 18 months of supervised probation. He must also resign from the school police force within 90 days.\nDocuments show a witness to the March 1 encounter said a second officer, Saverna Bias, told Spence to hit the youth, and Spence then hit and kicked the teen.\nSpence's attorney, Warren Brown, says the student spat on Spence.\nBias will go to trial on assault charges.",
