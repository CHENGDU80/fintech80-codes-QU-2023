    "maintext": "The mother of a girl at the center of a medical and religious debate over brain death says she doesn't regret moving from California to New Jersey so her daughter could receive care after being declared dead.\nNailah Winkfield told reporters Tuesday that she gave up everything for daughter Jahi McMath, but it was worthwhile. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Jahi will be buried Friday in Hayward, California.\nWinkfield says doctors declared Jahi dead on June 22 after an operation to treat an intestinal issue.\nMcMath had already been declared dead in December 2013 after suffering irreversible brain damage during routine surgery in California when she was 13.\nWinkfield refused to accept the conclusion and took McMath to New Jersey, which accommodates religions that don't recognize brain death.",
