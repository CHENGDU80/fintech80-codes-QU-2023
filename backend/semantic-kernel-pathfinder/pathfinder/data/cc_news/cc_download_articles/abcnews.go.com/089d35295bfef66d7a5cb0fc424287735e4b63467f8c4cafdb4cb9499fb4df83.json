    "maintext": "Shares of Netflix are streaming to new highs a day after the company announced its first true price hike in years.\nThat's a far different result compared with 2011 when Netflix separated its streaming and DVD-by-mail service and raised prices.\nAbout 600,000 customers fled and its stock price plummeted by 80 percent.\nBut Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is a different animal today. The production powerhouse landed more Emmy nominations this year than any TV network other than HBO.\nSome of that price hike, $1 per month for the company's most popular plan, will likely be plowed into the race to produce more blockbuster shows like \"Stranger Things.\"\nNetflix is up against HBO and Amazon, which has its own ambitions for great television.\nShares of Netflix hit $198.92 Friday.",
