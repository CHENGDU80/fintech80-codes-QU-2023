    "maintext": "A Utah woman has been arrested after she was identified as the pajama-wearing robber in at least six bank robberies in the Salt Lake City area, including five in less than two hours on Saturday morning, police said Monday.\nNannette Louise Perkins, 40, was arrested Sunday afternoon at home in suburban Taylorsville home after Salt Lake City police received a tip about her identity, Unified police Lt. Brian Lohrke said.\nAccording to police, the robber did little to hide her appearance during robberies Friday and Saturday morning at banks in Salt Lake City, Holladay, West Valley City, Cottonwood Heights and Sandy.\nShe was seen on bank surveillance camera images and described wearing pajama bottoms, black prescription eyeglasses, a dark shirt and a blue bandanna over dark hair in a ponytail or bun.\nLohrke said the robber passed notes to tellers, never showed a weapon and got cash in five of the six banks. She left one empty-handed.\nThe police spokesman said he did not know what Perkins was wearing when she was arrested.\nShe was being held at the Salt Lake County jail pending an initial court appearance on felony charges.",
