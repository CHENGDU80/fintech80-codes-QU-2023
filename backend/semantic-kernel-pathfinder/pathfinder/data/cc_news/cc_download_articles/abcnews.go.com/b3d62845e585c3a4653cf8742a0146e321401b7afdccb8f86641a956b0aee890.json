    "maintext": "Authorities in North Carolina have accused a woman of filing nearly 300 insurance claims for cancer even though she didn't have the disease.\nThe North Carolina Department of Insurance said in a statement Tuesday that 60-year-old Susan Leigh Huebotter is charged with insurance fraud and obtaining property by false pretenses over $100,000.\nThe statement says Huebotter presented 287 cancer and hospitalization policy claims that were fraudulent. According to the arrest warrants, Huebotter made the claims between 2009 and 2017 without being diagnosed, treated or undergoing surgery for cancer.\nWarrants say the false claims totaled $231,306.\nHuebotter was arrested March 22 in North Carolina's Lenoir County and jailed on a $250,000 secured bond.\nOnline records didn't indicate whether she has an attorney.",
