    "maintext": "A United Nations envoy says progress has been made on a compromise formula regarding how security will be enforced after ethnically divided Cyprus is reunified.\nBut Espen Barth Eide told the AP there's still \"a long way to go\" on a structure meeting the security concerns of rival Greek and Turkish Cypriots, as well as the east Mediterranean island's \"guarantors\" â€” Greece, Turkey and Britain.\nEide said after talks with Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades Wednesday that the U.N. is assisting in \"structuring\" the deal.\nThe complex issue of security has long stumped peace talks. Breakaway Turkish Cypriots insist on keeping Turkish troops and granting Turkey intervention rights in a reunified Cyprus, something which Greek Cypriots reject.\nCyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup aimed at union with Greece.",
