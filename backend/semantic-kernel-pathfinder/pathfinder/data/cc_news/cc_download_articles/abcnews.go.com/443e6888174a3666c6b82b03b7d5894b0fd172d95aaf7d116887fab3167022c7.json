    "maintext": "Grieving relatives on Tuesday buried two Guatemalan boys whose bodies were found stuffed in sacks over the weekend, a crime that shocked the violence-weary Central American country.\nTen-year-old Carlos Daniel Xiquin and 11-year-old Oscar Armando Toc Cotzajay left for school Friday but were apparently kidnapped. Their bodies were found Sunday near Ajuix, a hamlet in the township of San Juan Sacatepequez, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the capital.\nThe boys' throats had been slashed and their hands and feet bound. There were reports that strangers had offered them a ride, and neighbors reported a ransom demand was made.\nThe boys' caskets were accompanied to a cemetery by a parade of residents bearing white balloons and a banner reading \"Enough Violence, We Want Justice.\"\n\"These children were without sin,\" said Toc Cotzajay's mother, Maria Eurelia Toc.",
