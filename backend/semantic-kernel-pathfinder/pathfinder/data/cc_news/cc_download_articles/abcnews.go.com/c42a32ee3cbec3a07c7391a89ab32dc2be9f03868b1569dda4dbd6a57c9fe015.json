According to police, they had rescued him from an angry mob in the coastal West Papua city of Sorong.\nA photo released by police showed the dead teenager with a container of 70 percent alcohol placed beside him.\nThe leader of the Sorong Youth and Student Association, Simon Soren, who is representing Ayomi's family, said police officers returned Ayomi to his family home unable to stand or speak.",
