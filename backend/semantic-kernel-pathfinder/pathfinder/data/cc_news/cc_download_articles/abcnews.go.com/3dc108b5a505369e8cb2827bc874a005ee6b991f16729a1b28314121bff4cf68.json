Add Interest\nPresident Donald Trump is disputing a report that he watches hours of television each day, calling it, \"Another false story.\"\nThe president is pushing back against a report in The New York Times about his first year in office that mentioned he watches at least four hours of television a day, sometimes twice that amount.\nTrump says on Twitter that he \"seldom, if ever,\" watches CNN or MSNBC, \"both of which I consider Fake News.\" The president says he also never watches CNN anchor Don Lemon's show, \"CNN Tonight.\"\nThe Times said its story was based on interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress.\nTrump has repeatedly lodged complaints about mainstream news outlets that he argues have covered his presidency unfairly and inaccurately.",
