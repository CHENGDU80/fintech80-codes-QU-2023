    "maintext": "At 5 years old, Joseph Livingston faced a brutal third-degree burn. The cause: consumer fireworks.\nHe was celebrating Labor Day in Columbia, Md., with his neighbors back in 2016.\nOne of the neighbors was playing with fireworks when a sparkler went off, striking Joseph. He suffered first-, second- and third-degree burns on his legs.\nNow, at 7 years old, Joseph is still receiving treatments at Johns Hopkins’ Pediatric Trauma and Burn Unit after suffering the consequences of consumer firework dangers.\nJackson Lee/Getty Images\nThe National Fire Protection Association, a trade organization that advocates for fire safety, found that 12,900 people were treated at U.S. hospital emergency rooms for firework-related injuries last year. Children under the age of 15 accounted for more than a third of those injuries.\nFireworks can reach temperatures nearly 2,000 degrees and sparklers can reach 1,200, according to the organization.\nPaul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\nTo put that into perspective, water’s boiling point is 212 degrees.\nMore fires are reported on July 4 than any other day of the year and 50 percent of those are caused by fireworks, the organization found.\nIt urges people to not use consumer fireworks.",
