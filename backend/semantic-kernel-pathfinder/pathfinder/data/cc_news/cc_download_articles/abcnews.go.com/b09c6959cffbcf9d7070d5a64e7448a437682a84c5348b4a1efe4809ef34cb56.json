    "maintext": "Several U.S.-based climate scientists are about to win multi-year, all-expenses-paid grants to relocate to France.\nThe \"Make Our Planet Great Again\" grants are an effort by French President Emmanuel Macron to counter U.S. President Donald Trump on the climate change front. Macron announced a competition for the grants hours after Trump declared he would withdraw the U.S. from the global accord reached in Paris in 2015 to reduce climate-damaging emissions.\nMacron is unveiling the winners Monday evening ahead of a climate summit Tuesday aimed at giving new impetus to the Paris accord and finding new funding to help governments and businesses meet its goals.\nMore than 50 world leaders are expected in Paris for the \"One Planet Summit,\" co-hosted by the U.N. and the World Bank. Trump was not invited.",
