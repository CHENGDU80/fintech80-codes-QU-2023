    "maintext": "A trial is underway for an 18-year-old Pennsylvania man accused of fatally shooting a friend in the face and then taking a selfie with the victim's body.\nTwo officers testified Tuesday that Maxwell Morton, then 16, showed little emotion or concern about the February 2015 shooting of 16-year-old Ryan Mangan.\nWestmoreland County Detective James Williams told jurors \"when he described pulling the trigger, he had a little smirk on his face.\"\nPolice contend Morton took a photograph of himself with Mangan's body minutes after the shooting and an hour later sent the image via Snapchat while he played online video games with a teen in Wisconsin.\nThe defense has argued that the teens were playing with the gun and it accidentally fired.\nThe judge ruled Monday the selfie can be seen by the jury.",
