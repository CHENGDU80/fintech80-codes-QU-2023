    "maintext": "Charles Manson's cremated remains have been scattered nearly four months after the cult leader died in prison. A funeral was held Saturday following a court battle for the 83-year-old's remains.\nPastor Mark Pitcher of the Church of the Nazarene in Porterville, California, says 20 to 25 people attended the funeral.\nAmong them were Manson's grandson, Jason Freeman, and Freeman's wife, Audrey.\nFreeman prevailed last week in a months-long court fight for custody of Manson's remains.\nHis grandfather was cremated after the service and his ashes scattered.\nPitcher said Monday he agreed to lead the service because Freeman and his wife are Christians.\nManson was sentenced to life in prison for orchestrating the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and eight others.\nHe died in November.",
