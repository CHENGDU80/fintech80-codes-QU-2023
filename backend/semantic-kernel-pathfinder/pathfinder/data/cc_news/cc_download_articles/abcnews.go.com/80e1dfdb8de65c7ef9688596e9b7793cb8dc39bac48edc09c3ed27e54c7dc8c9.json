    "maintext": "Twiggy is still making an impression on the fashion industry with her iconic lashes.\nThe stuck together, spider-like lashes were huge back in the 1960s, made famous by the British model.\nKeystone Features/Getty Images\nThe trend features doll-like upper and lower lashes.\n“ ” It’s not about perfection, the more clumpier the better.\nThey went out of fashion for a bit but are now back and better than ever.\nMakeup artists have amped up the look with fake lashes and eyelash extensions.\nOther people are using the '60s-inspired lashes to make a simple everyday look.\nYou can get these \"Twiggy lashes\" by using eyelash extensions or a thick mascara.\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images\nNatalia Ferrara, Revitalash global brand ambassador, said Twiggy used to use false eyelashes to achieve her look, but nowadays people don’t have time.\nTo achieve the look without false eyelashes, Ferrara layers an eyelash primer and mascara. “The more bulk I get on my lash, the easier it is to separate with my third coat,” Ferrara told ABC News.\nHer one tip is to “always go vertical with the wand.”",
