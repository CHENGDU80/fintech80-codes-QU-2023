    "maintext": "Benedict XVI, who resigned as pontiff in 2013, has celebrated his 90th birthday with a mug of beer and the company of visitors from his native Bavaria in Germany.\nPhotos by the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano of the celebration showed Benedict sipping a beer. His brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, also joined the party and enjoyed a beer.\nLooking happy, the frail Benedict also admired a gift basket whose goodies included pretzels.\nHe was born on April 16, 1927, in southern Germany. But since the birthday coincided this year with Easter Sunday, Benedict was feted on Monday.\nOn a sunny, mild day, guests sat outside the monastery on Vatican City grounds where Benedict has lived since he became the first pontiff to resign in 600 years, stunning the Catholic Church.\n———\nThis story has been corrected to show that the gift basket contained pretzels, not sausages.",
