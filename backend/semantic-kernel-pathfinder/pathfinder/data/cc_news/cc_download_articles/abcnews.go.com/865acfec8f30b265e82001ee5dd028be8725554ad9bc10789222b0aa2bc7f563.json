It is moving north at 8 mph (13 kph).\nGert is expected to become a hurricane Monday night.\nA gradual turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is forecast for Tuesday night.\nSwells generated by Gert will begin to affect portions of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast — from North Carolina to New York — over the next couple of days.\nThe Hurricane Center says these swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",
