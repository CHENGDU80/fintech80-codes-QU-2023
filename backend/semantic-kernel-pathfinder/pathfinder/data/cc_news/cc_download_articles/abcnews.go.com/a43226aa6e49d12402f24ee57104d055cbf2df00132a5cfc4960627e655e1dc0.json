    "maintext": "Myanmar's government has vowed to take action against police officers shown beating villagers in a video that has circulated on the internet.\nMonday's front-page story in the state-owned Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper about the Nov. 5 incident was a rare official acknowledgment of abuses taking place in the western state of Rakhine. The authorities have been conducting counterinsurgency operations there since an attack in October by unidentified armed men killed nine border guards.\nHuman rights groups accuse security forces of abuses against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine, including rape, killings and the burning of more than 1,000 homes.\nMonday's story, which cited the office of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and police, did not say what punishment the police might face.",
