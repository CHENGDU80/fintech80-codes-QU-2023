    "maintext": "Georgia sophomore quarterback Jake Fromm suffered a small fracture in his non-throwing left hand earlier this week, but he won't miss any summer workouts, Georgia coach Kirby Smart told ESPN on Wednesday.\nUGASports.com first reported Wednesday that Fromm suffered the injury in a freak boating accident Monday on Lake Burton in northeast Georgia.\nSmart termed the injury as \"insignificant\" and said that Fromm already had resumed throwing.\nAs a true freshman last year, Fromm led Georgia to the SEC championship and an appearance in the College Football Playoff National Championship game, where the Bulldogs lost to Alabama.\nFromm finished with 2,615 passing yards, 24 touchdown passes and seven interceptions after taking the starting job away from Jacob Eason, who has since transferred to Washington.\nThe Bulldogs also are bringing in five-star quarterback Justin Fields, who was ranked by ESPN as the country's No. 1 prospect overall in the 2018 signing class.",
