    "maintext": "The Latest on sexual misconduct allegations against actor Steven Seagal (all times local):\n1:15 p.m.\nA lawyer for Steven Seagal says the actor adamantly denies sexual assault allegations made by two women against the action star.\nFaviola Dadis said at a news conference Monday that Seagal toucher her sexually without her consent in 2002 when she was 17, and Regina Simons said Seagal assaulted her in 1995 when she was 18.\nSeagal's attorney Anthony Falangetti said later Monday that the accounts of both women are \"completely fictitious and totally made up.\"\nHe says the allegations are a disservice to women who are victimized because of real predators in the film industry.\nThe women are the latest of several who have come forward in recent months to accuse the 65-year-old action actor of sexual misconduct. He has denied all of the allegations.\n———\n11:30 a.m.\nAn aspiring actress says she was 17 when actor Steven Seagal sexually assaulted her during a supposed casting session in 2002.\nFaviola Dadis said at a news conference Monday that she had recently moved to the U.S. from the Netherlands when she was invited to a Beverly Hills hotel room to audition for Seagal for a film he planned to make about Genghis Khan.\nThe 33-year-old former model says only Seagal and his bodyguard were in the room when the actor reached under her bikini top and then grabbed her genitals.\nDadis said she ended the audition and immediately left. She says she feared being blacklisted if she reported Seagal, and only recently filed a police report. Los Angeles County prosecutors say they are reviewing the case.\nSeagal's attorney Anthony Falangetti did not immediately return a message seeking comment.",
