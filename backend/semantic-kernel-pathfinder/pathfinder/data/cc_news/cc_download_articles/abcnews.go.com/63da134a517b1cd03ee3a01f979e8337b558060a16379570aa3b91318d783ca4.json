    "maintext": "Authorities on the Greek island of Lesbos say they have blocked a ship carrying container homes for refugees and other migrants in protest at the refusal of the government and the European Union to move more people to Greece's mainland.\nA government-chartered ship carrying the containers remained anchored at the island's main town Monday after municipal vehicles were used to block port facilities. The island's municipal board was due to meet later Monday to decide on whether to lift the blockade following talks with the government, state-run TV said.\nThe mayors of five Greek islands facing the coast of Turkey are demanding that the government and EU end a policy of containment for migrants — introduced last year as a deterrent against illegal migration — because living facilities are severely overcrowded.",
