    "maintext": "The Ottawa Senators needed a late rally in Game 2 to tie up their Eastern Conference quarterfinal matchup with the Boston Bruins.\nIn Game 3 they had to stave off a furious charge by the Bruins to regain the series lead.\nBobby Ryan scored on a tip-in on a power play 5:43 into overtime, and the Ottawa recovered after giving up a three-goal lead to beat Boston 4-3 Monday night and take a 2-1 edge in the first-round series.\nJust over a minute after Bruins center Riley Nash received a 2-minute penalty for roughing Ryan, Ryan got free in the zone, tapping it in on assists by Kyle Turris and Erik Karlsson. Mike Hoffman added two goals for Ottawa, with Derick Brassard scoring the other. Craig Anderson finished with 17 saves.\n\"I always say that you make your money during the season, but you make your reputation in the playoffs, and right now he's showing everybody that he's a gamer,\" Senators coach Guy Boucher said of Ryan.\nIt was the second straight overtime game of the series, and second consecutive win for the Senators following their 4-3 victory in Game 2.\nGame 4 is Wednesday night in Boston.\nThis time Bruins rallied from a 3-0 deficit with three goals in second period, tying the game on a power play goal by David Pastrnak.\nNoel Acciari and David Backes also scored for the Bruins. Tuukka Rask stopped 28 shots.\n\"We were allowed to play in the second and third (periods), we were a better team,\" Pastrnak said. \"We had many opportunities to end it in the third.\"\nBruins fans rained sustained boos on the referees after Ryan's goal and threw items on the TD Garden ice in protest of the Nash's penalty, which give the Senators the one-man advantage.\nBoston interim coach Bruce Cassidy said the penalty took the energy out of his team's surge to tie the game in regulation.\n\"Yeah, I agree with you 100 percent — demoralizing,\" he said.\nOttawa seemed to be cruising in the second period following Hoffman's second goal of the night off a power play to make it 3-0. But then Boston finally got going on the offensive end.\nFirst, Acciari, who returned from injury, got Boston on the board on a tip-in off a miss by John- Michael Liles. That was followed 42 seconds later by Backes' slap shot after he broke through the Senators defense to swipe the puck and open the ice.\nThen, the Bruins finally cashed in on Pastrnak's goal with Dion Phaeneuf in the penalty box for slashing.\nIt nearly nullified what was a dominating start by the Senators, who kept the action on their side of the red line for most of the first period.\nThe Bruins played through a rash of injuries in the first two games, and were missing defensemen Adam McQuaid, Torey Krug, Brandon Carlo and Colin Miller on Monday.\nAcciari and center David Krejci both returned, but Boston struggled early to find much offensive traction.\nHoffman and Brassard scored just 25 seconds apart in the first period and exploited a depleted Boston defense to give Ottawa an early 2-0 lead.\nThe Bruins made up for their sloppy start and came out more aggressive on the offensive end in the second period, scoring three goals on just seven shots — including the two in 42 seconds — to get back into the game.\nThe Senators outshot the Bruins 10-3 in the first, taking advantage of several defensive breakdowns on their side of the ice.\nOttawa's first goal of the night came after Erik Karlsson flipped a pass behind Boston's defense to spring Hoffman on a breakaway. Hoffman controlled the puck and easily tapped it by Rask into the right corner of the net.\nThen Brassard got on the board, slipping a slap shot by Rask for his second goal in two games.\nBackes had the best opportunity to score for the Bruins in first period, but his attempt to fire a glove side shot by Anderson was wide right, striking the post.\nIt was the first game of the series that the Bruins had trailed after the opening 20 minutes.\n\"Momentums are crazy,\" Anderson said. \"Win your little battles and it goes a long way in the war.\"\nNOTES: Ottawa was 2 for 4 on power plays. ... Acciari and Tommy Cross both played in their first NHL playoff games, bringing the total to 11 Bruins that have made their postseason debuts in the series.\n———\nMore AP NHL hockey at https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey",
