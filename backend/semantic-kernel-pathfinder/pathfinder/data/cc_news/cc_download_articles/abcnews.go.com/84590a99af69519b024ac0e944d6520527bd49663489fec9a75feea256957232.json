    "maintext": "The chairman of South Korea's Asiana Airlines has apologized for inflight meal service disruptions and a reported suicide at a meal supplier.\nPark Sam-koo, chairman of the country's second-largest air carrier, said he felt a moral responsibility after the boss of the company that had been supplying the meals killed himself, according to media reports citing police.\nThe apology came as criticism mounted following the reports, which linked the apparent suicide to pressure from Asiana on its caterer.\nAsiana Airlines said 114 out of 310 flights had left South Korea without meals since Sunday. Most were short-haul flights to Asian destinations.\nThe problems arose after the airline tried to change its meal catering service.",
