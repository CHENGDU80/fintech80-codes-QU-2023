    "maintext": "Robert L. McKay, who designed the first Taco Bell restaurant and with founder Glenn Bell turned it from a quirky food stand into a fast-food empire, has died. He was 86.\nHis son, Rob McKay, says McKay died last week from cancer.\nBell opened his first Taco Bell in Downey, California in 1962, selling hard-shell tacos and other Mexican-inspired fast food.\nMcKay was an architect and designed the Spanish-style arched and tiled building that became the chain's signature look.\nMcKay eventually became president of Taco Bell, which had some 900 restaurants when it was sold to PepsiCo in 1978.\nHe went on to finance other businesses that invested in technology, consumer products, real estate and banking.",
