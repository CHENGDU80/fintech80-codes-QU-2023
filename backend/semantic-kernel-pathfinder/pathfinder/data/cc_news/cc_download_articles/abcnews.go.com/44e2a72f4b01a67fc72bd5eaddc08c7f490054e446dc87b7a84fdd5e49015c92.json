    "maintext": "Supporters of cattleman and anti-federal figure Cliven Bundy are protesting a presidential decision to give national monument protection to public land where Bundy grazes cows near his southern Nevada ranch.\nThe Spectrum of St. George, Utah, ( http://bit.ly/2iVR3K7 ) reports that Bundy family members and friends staged a peaceful rally of about a few dozen people on Saturday near the Bundy home.\nFamily matriarch Carol Bundy is expressing fear that the government will ban grazing in the Gold Butte area â€” although the U.S. Interior Department says grazing will be allowed.\nAn armed standoff in April 2014 stopped a federal roundup of Bundy cattle and led to the arrest on federal charges of 19 people including five Bundy family members.\nTrial is set to begin Feb. 6 in Las Vegas for the first six defendants in that case.",
