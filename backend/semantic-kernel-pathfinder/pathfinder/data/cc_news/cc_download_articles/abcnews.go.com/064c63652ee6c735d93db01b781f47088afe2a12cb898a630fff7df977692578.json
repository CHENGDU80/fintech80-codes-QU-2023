    "maintext": "German prosecutors are staging a reconstruction of last week's attack on the Borussia Dortmund soccer team's bus as they look for clues about the perpetrators.\nThe federal prosecutor's office said the reconstruction was being conducted Tuesday. It said in a statement that the exercise is aimed at shedding light on what happened and on evidence found at the scene.\nThree explosions went off near the bus in suburban Dortmund last Tuesday, wounding a player and a police officer.\nThree copies of a note containing Islamic extremist rhetoric were found at the scene, but officials suspect it might be a red herring.\nProsecutors say a large surrounding area has been combed for further clues.\nTwo other possible claims of responsibility surfaced, one suggesting a far-left and the other a far-right motive.",
