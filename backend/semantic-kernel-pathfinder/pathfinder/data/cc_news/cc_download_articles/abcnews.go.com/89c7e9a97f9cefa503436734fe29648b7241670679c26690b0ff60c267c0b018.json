    "maintext": "Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which operates Hainan Airlines and other businesses around the world, says its co-chairman has died while on a business trip in France.\nHNA Group said Wang Jian, a co-founder of the company, suffered \"severe injuries\" in a fall and died Tuesday at age 57. It gave no other details.\nLaunched in 1993 on the southern island of Hainan, HNA grew to become China's fourth-largest airline and expanded into finance, hotels, logistics and other businesses in a multibillion-dollar global acquisition spree.\nMore recently, HNA has been selling some assets as Chinese regulators tighten lending controls and press companies to rein in debt.",
