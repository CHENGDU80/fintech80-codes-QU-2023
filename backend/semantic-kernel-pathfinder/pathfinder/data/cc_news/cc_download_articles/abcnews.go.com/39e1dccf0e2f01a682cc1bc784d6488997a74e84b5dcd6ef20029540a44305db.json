    "maintext": "A West Virginia man is facing a murder charge after authorities say he told his pastor he caused his mother's fatal overdose because he wanted to \"end her pain.\"\nNews outlets report that 44-year-old Bradford Spencer of Bluefield was arrested Saturday following the Jan. 31 death of 65-year-old Virginia Spencer.\nAuthorities say the man forced his mother to take numerous pain pills. He is charged with first-degree murder.\nBluefield police records say Spencer spoke to his pastor at a funeral home on Feb. 9, telling him that he regretted killing his mother, but he was tired of seeing her in pain. It's unclear what condition the woman was suffering from.\nSpencer was arraigned Monday and is being held on a $100,000 bond. Records do not show whether he has an attorney.",
