    "maintext": "A murder suspect who had been booked into a Central Texas jail with bond initially set at $4 billion bond has been released after he posted a reduced bond of $151,000.\nThe Bell County Sheriff's Office says Antonio Marquis Willis of Killeen was released Monday afternoon.\nBell County Justice of the Peace Claudia Brown said Friday that she set the multibillion-dollar bond as a protest to exorbitant bonds, which she said force too many people to remain in jail until trial.\nA state district judge lowered the bond to $151,000 on Friday. Brown had acknowledged her bond amount could be seen as a constitutional violation.\nWillis is charged with first-degree murder in the Dec. 22 shooting death of Donte Samuels in Killeen.",
