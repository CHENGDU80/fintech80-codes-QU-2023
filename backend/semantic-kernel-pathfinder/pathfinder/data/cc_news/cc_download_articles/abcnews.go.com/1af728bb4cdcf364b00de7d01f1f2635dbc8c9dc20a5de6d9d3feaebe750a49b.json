    "maintext": "The German economy, Europe's largest, continued its strong performance in the second quarter with gross domestic product growing 0.6 percent over the previous quarter.\nThe Federal Statistics Office said Tuesday the GDP growth followed an upwardly revised 0.7 percent growth in the first quarter, according to figures adjusted for seasonal and calendar variations.\nThe figures could bolster Chancellor Angela Merkel's re-election campaign, which has focused on Germany's record-low unemployment, balanced budget and strong economy. She's seeking a fourth term in September.\nING economist Carsten Brzeski says \"though some kind of a slowdown from current growth rates looks almost inevitable\" many signs point to more growth ahead and there's \"little reason to fear a sudden end to the current performance.\"\nHe says \"Germany's economic success story goes on and on and on.\"",
