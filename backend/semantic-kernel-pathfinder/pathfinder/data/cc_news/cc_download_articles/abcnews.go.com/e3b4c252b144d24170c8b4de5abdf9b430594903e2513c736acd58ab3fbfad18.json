    "maintext": "The U.N. human rights chief is lashing out at the \"refusal\" of some at the U.N.'s Human Rights Council to refer to Rohingya Muslims as such, calling it a sign of disrespect for the \"terrible violations\" they have faced.\nZeid Ra'ad al-Hussein provided an update Wednesday on the plight of the Rohingya in Myanmar, after more than 720,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last August amid a violent security crackdown. He was updating a report from his office that relayed accounts from fleeing Rohingya who said killings, enforced disappearances and house-burnings continue in Myanmar\nHe reiterated his call for the U.N. Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.\nMany Buddhists in Myanmar — a member of the council — call the Rohingya \"Bengalis\" and say they migrated illegally from Bangladesh, even though they have lived in the country for generations.",
