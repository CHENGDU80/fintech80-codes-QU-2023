    "maintext": "A wheelchair athlete who was injured after organizers of a San Diego marathon altered the course has been awarded $4 million.\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune says a jury this week ruled for Craig Blanchette in a negligence lawsuit against organizers of the 2014 Rock 'n' Roll marathon.\nBlanchette, a former Olympian, says on the morning of the race, organizers narrowed part of the course by eliminating one lane without telling the racers.\nBlanchette says he was doing about 20 mph when his wheelchair slammed into a car. The crash broke his collarbone and several ribs, tore his rotator cuff and ended his career as an elite racer.\nA representative for the race organizer, Competitor Group Inc., told the Union-Tribune that the company doesn't comment on ongoing litigation.",
