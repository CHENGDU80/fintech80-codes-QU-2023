    "maintext": "In what would be a major pivot away from a foreign policy position held by the previous administration, a White House official said Thursday night that the United States will not insist upon a two-state solution to settle the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\"Maybe, maybe not,\" said the official in a briefing at the White House. \"It's something the two sides have to agree to. It's not for us to impose that vision. But I think we'll find out more about that tomorrow.\"\nPresident Donald Trump is schedule to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday at the White House.\n\"A two-state solution that doesn't bring peace is not our goal that anybody wants to achieve,\" the official said. \"Peace is the goal, whether it comes in the form of a two-state solution if that's what the parties want or something else, if that's what the parties want, we're going to help them.\"\nThis is a developing story. Please check back in for updates.",
