    "maintext": "An envoy says Maldives will not extend the state of emergency that is due to expire on Thursday amid criticism of the government over the recent political turmoil.\nMohamed Hussain Shareef, ambassador to neighboring Sri Lanka, said the government \"has no intention of extending\" the emergency when its 30-day period expires, \"barring very unusual circumstances such as widespread violence.\"\nMaldives declared an emergency due to turmoil following a Supreme Court ruling ordering the release of several of the president's jailed political opponents. Under the emergency law, President Yameen Abdul Gayoom had two Supreme Court judges arrested for alleged corruption and the remaining three judges annulled the order to release Yameen's opponents.\nThe emergency regulations gave Maldives' security forces sweeping powers, including to make arrests and search and seize property.\n———\nThis story has been corrected to show emergency is set to expire Thursday, not Wednesday.",
