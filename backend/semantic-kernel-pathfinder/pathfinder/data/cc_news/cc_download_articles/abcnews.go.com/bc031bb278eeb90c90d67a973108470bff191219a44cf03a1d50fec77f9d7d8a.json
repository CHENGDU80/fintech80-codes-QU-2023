    "maintext": "A group of city counselors in Munich say they want the southern German city's main train station to have a landing pad for flying taxis.\nFive city council members from the Christian Social Union party submitted a motion Wednesday calling on rail company Deutsche Bahn to consider the space needed for flying taxis in its plans for a future redesign of the station.\nIn their motion, they write that \"it is to be expected that within a few years technology will have advanced so far that flying taxis can be used to transport people.\"\nThe party, which has a majority across Bavaria but is in opposition in the state capital's assembly, has recently been championing the idea of flying taxis as a future means of travel.",
