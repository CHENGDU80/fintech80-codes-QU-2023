    "maintext": "By Abby Hassler\nEvanescence’s new album Synthesis will contain re-imaginings of the group’s iconic catalog as well as two new tracks. The band is currently in the studio finishing the project with producer Will Hunt and orchestra arranger and composer David Campbell.\nRelated: Amy Lee on Her New Children’s Album\nEvanescence will support the new release with a fall tour featuring a full orchestra.\n“I’ve always wanted to shine a light on some of the gorgeous David Campbell arrangements and programming elements in our songs, and that idea snowballed into completely re-doing them with full orchestra, not just strings, elaborate programming and experimentation,” Lee explained. “This will be our first time touring with an orchestra and I’m so excited to perform this way-really focus on the vocals, and the emotion and the story we’ve built over the years.”\n“I’m also really excited about the new material on the album,” she continued. “Besides the two new songs, there are some really beautiful instrumental in-between moments. The whole thing flows like a big, dynamic soundtrack.”\nCheck out the complete tour dates below.\n10/14 – Las Vegas, NV @ The Pearl Concert Theater\n10/15 – Los Angeles, CA @ Greek Theatre\n10/17 – Phoenix, AZ @ Comerica Theatre\n10/20 – Houston, TX @ Revention Music Center\n10/22 – Irving, TX @ The Pavilion at Irving Music Factory\n10/23 – New Orleans, LA @ Mahalia Jackson Theater\n10/25 – Nashville, TN @ Ryman Auditorium\n10/27 – Atlanta, GA @ Chastain Park Amphitheatre\n10/28 – Charlotte, NC @ Ovens Auditorium\n10/30 – Pittsburgh, PA @ Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts\n10/31 – Oxon Hill, MD @ MGM National Harbor\n11/2 – Upper Darby, PA @ Tower Theater\n11/3 – Mashantucket, CT @ Foxwoods Resort Casino – Grand Theater\n11/5 – Boston, MA @ Orpheum Theatre – Boston\n11/7 – Bethlehem, PA @ Sands Bethlehem Event Center\n11/8 – Baltimore, MD @ Hippodrome Theatre\n11/10 – Brooklyn, NY @ Kings Theatre\n11/30 – Chicago, IL @ Chicago Theatre\n12/2 – Carmel, IN @ The Palladium\n12/5 – Minneapolis, MN @ State Theatre\n12/6 – Madison, WI @ Orpheum Theatre\n12/8 – Toronto, ON Canada @ Sony Centre for Performing Arts\n12/9 – Windsor, ON Canada @ Caesar’s Windsor\n12/11 – Kansas City, MO @ Kansas City Music Hall\n12/13 – Denver, CO @ Paramount Theatre\n12/15- Reno, NV @ Grand Theatre at The Grand Sierra Resort\n12/16 – San Francisco, CA @ Masonic Auditorium\n12/19 – Portland, OR @ Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall\nNever miss a tour date from Evanescence with Eventful.",
