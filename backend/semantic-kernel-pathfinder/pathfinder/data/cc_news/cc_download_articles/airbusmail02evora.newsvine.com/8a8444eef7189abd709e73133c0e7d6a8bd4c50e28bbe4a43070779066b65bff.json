    "maintext": "If you look good, you feel good! That is why more men and women are becoming interested in fashion each day. Good fashion means choosing a great style and wearing it well. Continue on into this article for fashion advice you can use yourself.\nIf you are going directly from work to an evening out on the town, take a few makeup basics with you to change your look. Consider darker lipstick and some smoky eye shadow to transform your look. You may also darken your blush a bit, providing some contour for darker time. These three products will ease the transition.\nWear cropped pants in a more flattering way by choosing capris, pedal pushers, and bermuda shorts that do not fall at the widest part of your calf. Choose pants that end above the knee or closer to the ankle. You should also avoid flared styles to keep your look streamlined.\nIf you are starting to go gray, try using a vegetable dye. As long as it is just a few strands that are causing anxiety, this product should do the trick. It turns the gray a shade that is a tad lighter than the rest of your hair. Using vegetable dye will make it look as though you have nice, new highlights and will then fade out over about three months.\nA good fashion tip is to select your clothing for the day based on color. You don't want to step outside with your shirt and shorts clashing because they're complimentary colors. Experiment with different color combinations and see which colors you like and which color combinations you don't like so much.\nHow to apply your makeup depends on where you are going. For example, if you are going for an interview, keep your makeup looking natural and highlight your best feature. For instance, if you have beautiful eyes, wear a soft color that enhances the color of your eyes. If your best feature is your cheekbones, add a little color to the apple of your cheeks.\nIf you have a lighter skin tone and you are looking to dye your hair a darker shade, consider dying it a dark shade of brown instead of opting for jet black. Choosing a brown tone is much more flattering since it will not make you look too washed out.\nUse up all your beauty products before getting rid of them. For tubed products, use a toothpaste tube squeezer to get every last drop. Try to get the last of the product by turning them upside down and squeezing the last bit out. Sometimes you can cut off the top to get another two or three uses of the product. This can save you money.\nHave yourself professionally fitted for a bra. An ill-fitting brassiere is not only unflattering, but it affects how your clothing fits. Once you know your true size, buy a few bras in different styles and cuts. A plunge or demi-cup bra, a strapless bra, and a convertible bra give you versatile options.\nBuy outfits that promote an hour-glass figure. No matter what the decade, that feminine outline is classic and always fashionable. This is why actresses like Marilyn Monroe are still considered beautiful even with the new model trend toward long and lanky women. Curves are always in as it implies femininity and fertility.\nQuirkiness is great for fashion. Try a combination of unmatched shoes, ruffled hair, and an unbuttoned shirt. There is little chance of accomplishing perfection, so embrace a controlled bit of chaos in your style to help stand out and present your own sense of style.\nBe confident. It doesn't matter how you dress if you don't feel that you look good. Work on your self-esteem. Don't just follow trends. Buy clothing that you feel looks flattering. Trust your own opinion before listening to anyone else. If you feel good about yourself, your confidence should shine through.\nWhen purchasing sneakers, shop for ones that are comfortable and fit like a glove. You should also ensure that the arch in the shoe fully supports the arch in your foot. Another consideration to take into account when purchasing sneakers is to know the pronation of your foot; most salespeople can assess your foot and guide you to the proper shoe for your pronation.\nWhen considering fashion for yourself, be sure to take into consideration what type of cuts look best on your body type. This is important because there are vastly different body types, and certain cuts look better on some than others. Find something that accentuates your best features and makes you feel comfortable.\nSave your old clothes. Trends and fashions go in cycles, so whatever you are wearing now is likely to have a comeback in ten years or more. Even if you do not think you would ever wear it again then, you might can swap clothes with someone looking for something vintage.\nWhen shopping for vintage clothing, don't make assumptions based on the size on the tag. A size 8 in the 1950s fits differently than a modern size 8, so save yourself some disappointments by always trying items on before buying them. Once you get a feel for how sizes have changed through the decades, you will have a better idea of what to look for.\nCurrently, skinny jeans have become all the rage in fashion. Skinny jeans don't mean you need a skinny frame. Nearly any shape looks good in them, as they tend to slim the body from the waist down. They go great with lots of different types of clothes and also shoes, too.\nAccessorize with bright colors. If you want your wardrobe to pop but find colorful prints and pastel colors in clothing too garish, you may find a solution in accessorizing. On its own, a black button up shirt and dress pants are bland. A red pair of shoes and handbag, however, can really make it stand out.\nTrying to find the right shoes for your outfit can be a challenge. First, make sure your shoes are right for the occasion. If you are wearing a dressy gown, avoid wearing flats. Avoid wearing shoes that exactly match your outfit. Instead, choose one color within your outfit and base your shoe color on that.\nThe preceding paragraphs have hopefully given you some ideas you were not aware of before now on how you can dress with a newly discovered fashion sense. You are going to notice how much more comfortable you are in going through life. With luck, your new style will open doors for you.",
