    "maintext": "Understanding fashion can help you to look and feel your best. If you have a bad fashion sense and are unhappy with your look, this article will be of great benefit to you. Read on to learn a number of fashion tips that will help you to improve your style and look.\nIf you wear stockings, keep a small bottle of clear nail polish with you. If you get a snag or run, a small drop of the polish will help stop it before it gets bad. Remember that it only takes a small amount to work so, do not overdo it, or you will have a sticky mess.\nSheer clothing can be sexy, but it is important that it is not too sheer. If your pants, skirt or shirt are too sheer in private areas, the result can be a cheap or trashy look that will not make you feel classy.\nAdd some fun to your wardrobe by wearing pieces with some interesting prints and patterns. You could wear geometric patterned shirts or striped patterned skirts. You could even wear animal print heels or polka-dotted dresses. Whether you desire a classy or an edgy look, you can find a print or pattern to fit your style.\nThe basic black dress is essential for any woman's wardrobe. You can wear this dress for casual occasions by accessorizing it with a pair of comfortable pumps. You can wear the same dress for a more formal occasion if you put up your hair and accessorize with a pearl necklace and earrings.\nAlthough it may have been popular years ago, wearing clothing that does not match is not in style anymore. Whether you are wearing jeans and a top, a suit, or a skirt and shirt, be sure the top and bottom match. The same goes for the accessories you choose to wear.\nThere is nothing wrong with using hair accessories, but do not use too many at once because it will make you look tacky. Limit them to no more than two at a time. Furthermore, avoid using hair accessories that are so large that they overpower your hairstyle or make your head look too small.\nNobody is perfect when trying to be fashionable, so do not set your goals on perfection. For starters, there is no one who is perfect. If you focus on perfection, you lose the freedom to be yourself. You might have noticed that the \"rough\" look is actually a great look anyone can pull off. For example, some hair that's out of place, or a jacket that's worn and torn, etc, can create a purposeful tattered look that really stands out in a crowd.\nBy increasing the amount of water that you drink, you can help protect your nails from dryness. If you are not properly hydrated, your nails will probably reflect it, appearing dry and brittle. If the air is dry and frigid, such as in the winter, you need to moisturize frequently. Also, make sure that you moisturize your nails daily to maintain health. You can also put on shea butter or some other type of hand cream on your hands and place a cotton glove on top while you go to sleep.\nAlways dress respectfully for the occasion. Don't wear a tube top if you're going to a wedding, and don't shorts to the prom. Learn to respect fashion traditions, even if you're tempted to defy them for no good reason. Is it really going to hurt to to put on that tie Mom wants you to wear to church? Showing respect in how you dress will gain you respect in return.\nWhen you dry your hair, you should just pat or blot it dry with a towel instead of rubbing your hair with a towel. Rubbing tangles and breaks your hair and can even lead to loss of hair. When you are blow-drying your hair, use a low setting and move the blow dryer constantly so that you don't fry one section of hair. Don't hold the blow dryer too close as this can cause harm to your hair and even burn you.\nTo stretch your wardrobe's versatility, fill your wardrobe with a variety of scarves and belts in different patterns and styles. You can use these to add a splash of interest to a solid colored top. You can use these in countless combinations to create a different look each time without needing to buy a different outfit.\nHave jeans professionally hemmed. Creating a hem isn't difficult with a sewing machine, but a good tailor can remove fabric from above the hem and reattach it. This preserves that crisp look and the original stitching. The result is a well-fitting pair of jeans that appears to have come straight off the rack.\nIf you are going to be in the hot weather, wear clothes that are made from natural fabrics so your skin can breath. Cottons and silks are ideal materials for summer clothes. Avoid synthetic fibers, like polyester, that are not as effective in keeping you cool because they tend to stick to you.\nIf you are small and petite, then you should avoid wearing strong prints and loose, chunky clothing. This will not look good on you. Instead, you should aim for fitted clothing and soft fabrics, and ensure that you streamline everything so that your body is not being cut in half.\nNow that you have these fashion tips, you don't have to admire your favorite celebrities looks from the television screen. You can actually look like your favorite celebrities. There are so many pieces of clothing that you can use to achieve this look, so go out there and find them.",
