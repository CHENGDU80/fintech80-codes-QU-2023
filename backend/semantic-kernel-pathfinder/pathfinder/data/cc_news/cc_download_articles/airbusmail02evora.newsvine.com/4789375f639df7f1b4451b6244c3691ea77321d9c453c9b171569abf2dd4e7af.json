    "maintext": "Do you feel like you have to reestablish your fashion sense? Well do you feel like it might cost you too much money? If so then you are going to want to have a look through this article to figure out how to build your fashion sense on a budget.\nLooking great does not have to cost a fortune. If you want to build your wardrobe but don't have the funds to get the look you're after, check out your local thrift and consignment stores. These stores offer a plethora of fashion options at a fraction of their retail price.\nWhen you wear two items of the same color, make sure that the shades are a perfect or near-perfect match. For example, do not wear a navy blue shirt with a midnight blue pair of pants. Even though they are both blue, it does not look as well put together as it would have if both pieces were the same color.\nTight levis can look attractive on someone who is fit with a slender figure, but if you are a bit on the heavy side, look for jeans that fit well without being tight. Your extra pounds will be even more noticeable if you look as if your pants are painted on you.\nDress up black jeans with a fancy shirt or some heels for a classic evening look. Wear colored jeans if you want a more casual look.\nIn order to make sure that you can fit into the latest fashion trends you are going to want to make sure that you are as slim as possible. Diet and exercise so you don't feel embarrassed because you can't fit into some of the latest trends that this season's fashion has to offer you.\nA very important fashion tip is to make sure that your pants are the correct length. This is important because having pants that are too long or short can be a critical mistake in looking good. Be sure to plan for the type of shoes that you will be wearing because it will make a huge difference.\nBuy the right size clothing. Too many women wear shirts, skirts, and even bras that are too tight. This is very unflattering. Buying clothing that fits right will have you looking your best. It will also allow you to breathe and be comfortable in what you're wearing. Part of being fashionable is being at ease with your choices.\nDress for your body type. Take the time to understand your shape, and how to use clothes to enhance your natural assets. Women who know how to work with their body, instead of hiding it, are the ones people notice when they walk into a room. Be proud of your shape, and work with it to boost your fashion esteem.\nWhen you get a haircut, keep your face shape in mind. Certain face shapes look better with certain hairstyles. Oval faces look great with nearly any hairstyle, while round faces do better with hairstyles that have height. Pear faces look better with round cuts and triangular faces look better with short cuts. Square faces look great with all kinds of cuts, except those that are flat on top.\nA new jacket may have some loose stitches around the shoulders and vents. These threads are not a fashionable look, which means that you should remove them. Just snip them off with a small pair of scissors. That's a simple style tip for you.\nInvest in the basics. Every wardrobe should have a few key pieces. The little black dress is a classic for good reason. A well-fitted white blouse is versatile and flattering. A tailored suit is perfect for serious business. These items are ones you shouldn't be afraid to spend a little extra on, as they are timeless classics that last beyond the changing fashion trends.\nTo stretch your wardrobe's versatility, fill your wardrobe with a variety of scarves and belts in different patterns and styles. You can use these to add a splash of interest to a solid colored top. You can use these in countless combinations to create a different look each time without needing to buy a different outfit.\nIf you are going to be in the hot weather, wear clothes that are made from natural fabrics so your skin can breath. Cottons and silks are ideal materials for summer clothes. Avoid synthetic fibers, like polyester, that are not as effective in keeping you cool because they tend to stick to you.\nIf you are small and petite, then you should avoid wearing strong prints and loose, chunky clothing. This will not look good on you. Instead, you should aim for fitted clothing and soft fabrics, and ensure that you streamline everything so that your body is not being cut in half.\nKnowing how to practice good fashion is one thing, but actually following through and practicing fashion is another. Try your best to follow all of the tips from this article so that you can have recreate your image. It's great to feel good about yourself once you have established good fashion habits and look good with what you wear again.",
