This will open your pores and help to eliminate black heads. Follow with a cold water rinse to close the pores and continue your makeup routine.\nMany women like to use concealer under their foundation. If you've run out of concealer, or can't find it, look inside the cap of your foundation. Liquid and lotion foundations tend to collect and thicken inside the cap and will work well in a pinch as an emergency concealer.\nIt does not matter how tired or pressed for time you may be, you should never skip your cleansing rituals. Drier skin benefits from thick, creamy cleansers, whereas oily skin benefits most from cleansing balms, washes, or bars.

Rinse your nails, and admire the lack of yellow coloring.\nGet your sleep to keep yourself looking beautiful. Do not underestimate the power of scarce sleep to age your face, and your body.

After washing your hair, squeeze out all excess water and apply a healthy dollop of conditioner to your hair, focusing on your hairline, the nape of the hair, and the ends. Apply a shower cap and let the conditioner soak in 10 minutes before you rinse it out. You'll have gorgeous silky hair when it dries!\nTo give more definition to your eyes apply mascara.
