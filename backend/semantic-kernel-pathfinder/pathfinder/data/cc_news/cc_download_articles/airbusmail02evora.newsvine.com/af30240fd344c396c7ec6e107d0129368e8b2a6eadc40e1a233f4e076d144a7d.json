So continue on for some great tips and tricks of the trade you can use to better your beauty routine.\nClean your face, and make sure you exfoliate. Exfoliation is a great technique to use in order to reveal the healthy skin layers that are hiding underneath the visible skin. If you have sensitive skin, you may not want to exfoliate every day, but you should still at least try to do it once or twice a week. This will give your face a fresh, radiant glow and will prevent your pores from becoming blocked by oils and dead skin cells.\nAdd volume to your hair. You can easily do this by blow drying your hair upside-down for at least 10 minutes. When your hair is dry, give it a cool blast of air to set the volume in. You can make your hair have more bounce and volume just by doing this.\nUse a face mask at least once a week. Depending on which one you choose, this will help remove impurities from your face. A mud or clay mask is best for removing impurities. You will see results immediately. Once you find a mask you like, you should stick with it.\nAdd volume to your hair. You can easily do this by blow drying your hair upside-down for at least 10 minutes. When your hair is dry, give it a cool blast of air to set the volume in. You can make your hair have more bounce and volume just by doing this.\nMost women would be surprised to know that the average female devotes more than 60 hours of her life to the ordeal of shaving and waxing. Laser hair removal, while somewhat costly, will save you a great deal of time and nicks on your legs, underarm, face, and bikini area.\nIf you have an overly pale appearance this can be due to iron deficiency. Take a daily iron supplement or eat a spoonful of iron-rich manuka honey. This will help you look healthier and give your skin a natural glow.\nExfoliating your body prior to applying tanning lotion or spending time in a tanning bed will extend the life of your tan! Since skin sheds, it's best to do as much of it as possible before getting that great tan so you can keep the glorious glow even longer! Any natural exfoliant applied a day or two before tanning will do!\nFor shiny, colorful, rich, beautiful hair, it's important to wash your hair regularly with a good, low-oil shampoo. This is the only way to effectively prevent dandruff and other hair-related ailments. Make sure to also rinse your hair out weekly with apple cider vinegar to wash away chemicals from shampoo.\nTo get a smoother look when applying your eyeshadow, apply primer first. Primer will give the eyeshadow an even surface and will create a smooth effect. It will also make your eyeshadow color look brighter and more vibrant. Be sure to choose a primer specifically designed for use on the eyes.\nIf you're in between hair dresser appointments, and need to hide some roots, use dark mascara on black or brunette hair and gold eye shadow on blond hair! Nobody is perfect and if you've scheduled your hair salon appointment too far in advance to save your roots from showing, brush them lightly with appropriately colored mascara or combine hair spray and blond shades of powder to conceal those roots until you can see your stylist!\nAs a man who enjoys looking good, you are sure to be concerned with the appearance of your hair. Products like conditioner and gel should be considered necessities!\nSmoking, besides being linked to a myriad of health problems, also has an extremely negative affect on the way you look. One of the best beauty tips is to never smoke a cigarette in your life, and if you are a smoker, stop immediately. Smoking prematurely ages the skin and causes wrinkles, it makes acne worse and it turns your teeth yellow.\nWhen you are dealing with itchy skin from using makeup with powdered minerals, opt for brands that do not incorporate bismuth oxychloride. Many women feel they can't wear mineral makeup because of this one ingredient; thankfully, many brands avoid this pigment.\nIf you have skin that tends to get shiny, you can do one of two things throughout the day. If you want to be fancy, you can buy a packet of face-blotting sheets. These smell wonderful and are impregnated with scented transparent powder. Or you can take a sheet of regular toilet paper and press, not rub, on the oily areas.\nBecause hair is so fragile, drying it too roughly can damage it and cause frizziness. A better way to use a towel to dry your hair is to gently scrunch and pat dry wet hair. This will cost you more time, but you will look better when it is finished.\nNow that you've gleaned some tips to help you stay radiant 24/7, it's going to be hard not to look in every mirror you pass. Enjoy your new confidence when you apply the advice that you've learned here, and get used to the constant compliments that you'll be receiving from admirers and envious others.",
