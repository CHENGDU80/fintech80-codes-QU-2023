You can't be sure when an image will be taken with all of the tech gadgets like smartphones and cameras out. To always have great fashion sense, read on for easy tips.\nOnly buy clothes that are flattering to your figure. Do not think that you must have every fashion trend that is available, even if it does not look good on you. No matter how trendy an item is, if it is not flattering to your figure, don't consider buying it.\nAsk your family how they feel about the way you dress. Tell them that you are considering changing the way you dress and that you would like some constructive feedback from them. They can help you figure out a style that works for you since they know the most about how you've dressed your while life.\nA perfect fashion tip is to try to keep your hands as free as possible when it comes to your bag. Get a trendy looking strap to wear across your body to keep your hands free and also to add a bit of style to your outfit. It could make the difference between being clumsy and being in control.\nThe color of your skin should determine what color clothing you should wear. If you are very pale, avoid colors that will make you appear paler, like beiges, yellows and whites. On the other hand, if you have darker skin, lighter colors, like light blues, pinks and yellows will compliment your skin.\nA good fashion tip is to start experimenting with your style if you've become very bored with your wardrobe. You can do this by simply trying out a new type of clothing that you've never worn before such as a scarf or certain kind of dress. This will definitely freshen up your wardrobe.\nA good fashion tip is to start experimenting with your style if you've become very bored with your wardrobe. You can do this by simply trying out a new type of clothing that you've never worn before such as a scarf or certain kind of dress. This will definitely freshen up your wardrobe.\nIf you have old apparel that you don't like anymore, donate them. You will clear up space in your closet and help people that are less fortunate as well.\nFor a fun and simple daytime look, wear your hair in a casual up-do. Use an accessory that coordinates with your outfit to hold most of your hair in place. Allow some gentle pieces to fall out and frame your face. You will feel cooler, and look casually appealing to everyone!\nIt's ok to mix up prints and colors in your fashion choices. Many people think that layering a print on top of another print is a fashion no-no, but it can work and look extremely stylish. Just make sure that your clothes have classic lines. It's when you've got multiple prints and crazy clothing shapes that the fashion police will take notice.\nAlways dress respectfully for the occasion. Don't wear a tube top if you're going to a wedding, and don't shorts to the prom. Learn to respect fashion traditions, even if you're tempted to defy them for no good reason. Is it really going to hurt to to put on that tie Mom wants you to wear to church? Showing respect in how you dress will gain you respect in return.\nDon't buy clothes that don't fit you, vowing to yourself that you'll \"get into them.\" While it's an admirable goal, it rarely works out that way. The vast majority of women never do \"get into them,\" and just end up wasting money on sometimes expensive clothing. Lose weight first; then go shopping.\nWhen purchasing jeans, go for timeless looks. For example, classic straight leg or boot cut jeans never go out of style. Opt for either of these styles in either a dark denim or slightly faded to remain in style throughout the years. By opting for these styles, you will always be in style no matter the current fashion.\nWIth everything that you learned about fashion today you should feel a lot better about how you look every day. There is a lot you can do to improve your image and to make people look at you a few times as they pass by. Best of luck impressing people with your fashion sense.",
