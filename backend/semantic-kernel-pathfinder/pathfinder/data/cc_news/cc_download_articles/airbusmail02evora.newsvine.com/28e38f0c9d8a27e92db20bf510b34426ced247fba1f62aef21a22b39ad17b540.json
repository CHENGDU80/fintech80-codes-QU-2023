    "maintext": "It's a wonderful feeling to look good. If you are in a fashion slump and need a little help, it's hard to know where to get the right information. What is flashy and what is classic? Here are some tips to help you pick pieces that flatter you no matter what the season is.\nA great looking purse can complement your outfit, but make sure it goes with whatever other bag you are carrying. This means your purse should match your briefcase if you need to use both of them on the same occasion. You should only ever have a maximum of two bags on you at the same time.\nFor a simple way to look more stylish, swap out your cheap rubber flip-flops for a pair of strappy sandals in leather, patent, or another eye-catching, grown-up material. Your feet will still be comfortable, but you will instantly look more put-together and polished. Look for embellished styles with beads, embroidery or funky hardware.\nIt has become fashionable for men to wear clothes that are very baggy, but this should be avoided. This makes you look sloppy and can make you look larger than you really are. While you do not have to wear anything that is too restricted, one size larger than your actual size should be the limit.\nBuild your wardrobe around basic staples that you can mix and match easily. Some key pieces include a little black dress, a fitted jacket and matching skirt, a tailored pair of slacks in a neutral color and a pair of dark, fitted trouser jeans. These items can take your almost anywhere paired with the right top and/or accessories.\nHats are a great accessory to match any kind of outfit. For men, there are the typical fisherman hats and baseball caps, but for women, the possibilities run much deeper. For instance, you can wear a cute sun hat, floppy hat or beach hat with any casual dress you own.\nBlack clothing makes people look thinner. This will mask your look so that you are not emphasizing bulges. Skirts with elastic waistbands will feel better on.\nDon't fall for a fashion trend if it doesn't fit your frame well. Everyone may be wearing the newest fashion fad, and you'll be tempted to follow suit. But if the newest style is not complementary to your physical frame, you will only be doing yourself a fashion disservice.\nMousse is an excellent tool in adding volume to thin hair if used properly. Although big hair is gaining popularity again, it is not flattering on most people.\nFind the right balance between fashionable and comfortable. Pain doesn't have to equal beauty. Just because a pair of shoes or a lacy dress are aesthetically pleasing doesn't mean you should wear them. Don't just check to see if something fits. Before you spend any money, try to determine whether you will be able to wear what you are buying for extended periods of time.\nThe most flattering clothes are ones that fit properly. Clothes that are too tight will put the spotlight on your body's flaws and clothes that are too loose will add the appearance of extra pounds. No matter what the style, color or material, clothes that are the right size will help you look great.\nTo push your style, try layering a fun skirt over a dress. There are many dresses out there that would make excellent tops. Just throw a skirt over the dress itself. The skirt should be made of thicker fabric, so you don't have unseemly bunching. You could even have the dress peek out a bit below the skirt for a fun, unorthodox look.\nWhen you get a haircut, keep your face shape in mind. Certain face shapes look better with certain hairstyles. Oval faces look great with nearly any hairstyle, while round faces do better with hairstyles that have height. Pear faces look better with round cuts and triangular faces look better with short cuts. Square faces look great with all kinds of cuts, except those that are flat on top.\nWhen you dry your hair, you should just pat or blot it dry with a towel instead of rubbing your hair with a towel. Rubbing tangles and breaks your hair and can even lead to loss of hair. When you are blow-drying your hair, use a low setting and move the blow dryer constantly so that you don't fry one section of hair. Don't hold the blow dryer too close as this can cause harm to your hair and even burn you.\nWhen choosing sunglasses or glasses, let your face shape be your guide. If you have an oval shape, any shape will look good. But if you have a round face, opt for rectangular frames or square frames. Avoid round frames. You might choose round frames if you have an angular or heart-shaped face, to soften up your look.\nIf you are a little heavy, stay away from fitted clothing. This will emphasize any lumps or bulges that you probably want to hide. Find tops that are fitted up top, but have a looser or flared fit around your waist. This will highlight the assets of your shape while hiding any unsightly bums.\nOne fashion barrier when wearing eyeliner, is keeping it from running or smearing throughout the day. To prevent this, you should ensure that you get the right brand of eyeliner. There are special brands that are stay proof. These are ideal eyeliners that will last all day, every day.\nNow that you've read this article, you should have a much better self esteem regarding fashion and your own personal flavor. Fashion is better if it's unique, and you can do that since you're a unique person. Remember the tips and advice you've read here as you work towards fashion in your life.",
