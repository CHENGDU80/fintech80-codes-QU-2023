    "maintext": "Mark Zuckerberg is on a worldwide apology tour for misusing your personal data.\nThe fact is: millions of companies make billions cramming unwanted ads down your throat. An unethical process plays out behind the scenes. Your personal information is collected then passed to anonymous intermediaries for analysis.\nThe result? More unwanted ads. Your breached privacy is sold to the highest bidder - strangers you will never meet. Strangers who want to know everything about you. Do you feel violated? Good! You should. This is a gross invasion of your privacy. But now there's a way to fight back.",
