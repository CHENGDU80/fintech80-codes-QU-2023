    "maintext": "By Robyn Collins\nEd Sheeran never made it to his label’s Grammys party. It’s not like he didn’t want to go, he wasn’t allowed in.\nRelated: Ed Sheeran Surprised by Comeback Success\nAfter the British singer/songwriter performed his new single, “The Shape of You,” at the GRAMMYs, he tried to get into his party, but he was turned away along with a crowd of others, so he went to another afterparty to celebrate.\n“That’s actually happened four years in a row, and that’s not just my label’s after-party, that’s just afterparties in general,” he told NME. “It’s just—do you know what I don’t get… it’s like you walk into those parties and there’s four musicians there and everyone else there are people from L.A. who didn’t even go to the GRAMMYs and just want a party to go to.”\n“So I went to Benny Blanco and Diplo’s party and arrived there super-early,” he continued, “and suddenly 2,000 people turned up.”",
