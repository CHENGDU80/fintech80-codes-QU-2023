It’s been hard to keep the secret 🤐, but since Mima USA sent me the COOLEST stroller (& matching bag) in the world, I thought: what better way to tell you all the news?! (Don’t be surprised to see Burgess holding A LOT of file folders in front of her stomach on #ChicagoPD.) #expecting#babyonboard #mimausa #MIMA 👶🏻 — with Mima.”\nAnyone else think they should just write her pregnancy into the show and have Rozek be the daddy?",
