    "maintext": "By Scott T. Sterling\nSam Smith has announced that his new album The Thrill Of It All will be released on November 3.\nThe announcement was coupled with the release of a new single, “Pray.” The song is mid-paced and emotive, matching Smith’s powerful vocals with piano and a sparse beat, and gradually blossoming with a background choir, strings and guitar. “Pray” was produced by Timbaland.\nThe singer also announced a large run of North American tour dates for 2018.\nRelated: Sam Smith Shares Emotional ‘Too Good at Goodbyes’ Video\nSmith recently sat with Radio.com to discuss the new album.\n“It’s a diary, but not just about me, the singer said. “It’s my thoughts and feelings on my family, fame, the world, all these different things. It’s still a diary just attacked it from a different angle.”\nSam also opened up about the role his family played in the making of his sophomore effort.\n“My family have been a part of every single moment of this record, I live with my sister so every time I come back from the studio, I play her everything I’ve made,” he said. “I sat with my mom and dad this time a lot and actually my mom throws amazing dinner parties and I would go over their house and we’d all crack open a bottle of wine and we’d sit round the table and I’d play them stuff. They’re actually really honest with me and when they’re not feeling something they’ll let me know, and I’ll disagree with them.”\n“My dad hated, “Stay with Me” I remember when I played it for him he absolutely hated it, so they’re very honest,” he continued.\n“Some of my family’s stories have made it into the album so, which, it’s an amazing thing. The relationships my family have been in have inspired songs so it’s also their diary now as well.”\nSam Smith is set to perform at this year’s We Can Survive concert, set for Oct. 21 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Smith will appear alongside Alessia Cara, Harry Styles, Kesha, Khalid, Lorde, Macklemore, P!nk and Sam Hunt.\nCheck out “Pray” and the full tracklisting for The Thrill Of It All below.\nThe Thrill Of It All – Standard Track Listing\nToo Good At Goodbyes\nSay It First\nOne Last Song\nMidnight Train\nBurning\nHim\nBaby, You Make Me Crazy\nNo Peace (feat.
