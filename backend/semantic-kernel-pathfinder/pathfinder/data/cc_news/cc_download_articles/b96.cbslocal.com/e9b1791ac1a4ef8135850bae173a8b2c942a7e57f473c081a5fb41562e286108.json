    "maintext": "By Robyn Collins\nBritney Spears lived out the dream of millions of teenage girls when *NSYNC sang “Happy Birthday’ to her. Only, it wasn’t the real Britney and the guys in *NSYNC weren’t the ones who sold millions of records.\nThe bizarre moment is captured in an upcoming Lifetime original movie, Britney Ever After.\nRelated: Britney Spears Subtweets Katy Perry Over Rude GRAMMY Comments\nThe project does not have the support of pop princess so it will be interesting to see how the network navigates her story without the rights to her music.\nIn the film, Natasha Bassett plays Britney, while Nathan Keyes, Zac Vran, Connor Paton, Frankie Cena and Matt Visser respectively take on the roles of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick and Joey Fatone.\nBritney Ever After airs Saturday, Feb. 18 at 8:00 p.m. on Lifetime.",
