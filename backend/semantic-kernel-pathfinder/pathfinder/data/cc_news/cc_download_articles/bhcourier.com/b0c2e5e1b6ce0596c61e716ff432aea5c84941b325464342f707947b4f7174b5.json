    "maintext": "President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania and their 11-year-old son Barron kicked off the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday.\n“This is the 139th easter egg roll. Think of it, 139,” Trump said from the balcony overlooking the south grounds of the executive mansion. He was accompanied by somebody dressed up in an Easter bunny costume.\nThe Trumps then went down and joined the crowd briefly.\nThe day-long, family-oriented event features many activities including an actual roll in which kids race against each other, pushing colored eggs along the ground with a wooden spoon.\n“We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before,” said Trump, before wishing the crowd a happy Easter under overcast skies in Washington.\nThe Easter egg roll at the White House was started in 1878 when Rutherford Hayes was president.\njca/are/dw/jm\n© Agence France-Presse\nShare this Story",
