                "body": "Aid agencies have said it would be \"impossible\" for doctors in Gaza to evacuate a hospital where thousands of people are sheltering, after Israel was accused of deliberately conducting aerial strikes in its vicinity.\n\nOn Sunday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said it received warnings from Israeli authorities to immediately evacuate the al-Quds hospital, where 14,000 people are taking refuge.\n\nBut the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said it would be \"impossible\" to carry out an evacuation without endangering patient lives.\n\nIsrael's military has yet to comment on the hospital evacuation order, but say they are targeting networks of Hamas tunnels that lie underneath hospitals, schools and mosques in Gaza.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is continuing to worsen as the conflict between Israel and proscribed terror group Hamas, enters a fourth week.\n\nOn Saturday, crowds of people broke into Gaza aid warehouses to take food and other \"basic survival items,\" the United Nations (UN) agency for Palestinian refugees said.\n\nThe break-in was described as \"a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down\" by the agency's director in Gaza.\n\nAs the death toll from the conflict soars, Save the Children said the number of children killed in the Gaza Strip since October 7 has exceeded the number of children killed in armed conflict every year globally since 2019.\n\nCivilians in Gaza have been asked to \"surrender\" by Israel's military as part of a leaflet drop made on Sunday.\n\nWritten in Arabic, the leaflets told civilians to lay down all their weapons, put their hands up, wave white flags, and follow instructions from the Israeli military.\n\nIsrael is continuing to mount a land, air and sea offensive against Hamas, with its aerial bombardment last Friday briefly knocking out most communications for Gaza's 2.3 million people.\n\nRachel Townsend reports from Tel Aviv as the Palestinian Red Crescent say that the Al-Quds hospital has received calls demanding its evacuation\n\nCommunications were lost for around 24 hours before they were restored on Sunday morning.\n\nIsrael - without presenting any evidence - has continued to allege that Hamas have built underground bunkers below Gaza's largest hospital - the Shifa hospital - and accused the group of using civilians as human shields. Hamas have denied the claims.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden's security adviser has suggested that Hamas could be preventing British nationals from leaving Gaza.\n\nJake Sullivan said Egypt and Israel were prepared to allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing - the only border point in the territory that is not controlled by Israel.\n\nBut he said Hamas had not agreed to terms that would grant foreigners an opportunity to depart for Egypt and reach safety.\n\nWant a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

                "body": "Jeon Chung Jo has told countless lies to Nam Hyun Hee during their period of dating. As Nam speaks out on them one by one, it seems like the public's sentiments are also shifting. While they were highly sympathetic to her in the beginning, they are now suspicious of her intentions when she had begun dating Jeon.\n\nOne of Nam's previous claims was how Jeon gained her friendship and trust initially by lying that he only had 6 months left to live. After this, the became friends and later lovers. Netizens wondered if Nam had her eye on his assets then. They compared the situation to a makjang drama, a drama genre known for its ridiculous plot twists.\n\nNam Hyun Hee also claimed that Jeon previously tricked her into thinking that she was pregnant with his baby. He had given her fake pregnancy test kits to convince her. Despite this, during her interview on October 30, she claimed that she had never seen his body as she did not want to have a change of heart after seeing his post-sex-change operation body. Netizens were in doubt about this claim.\n\nAs the plot thickens, stay tuned for more of the latest news on the ex-couple.",

                "title": "Hollard Life Solutions amplifies its specialised risk insurance offering with wellness coaching",
                "body": "Hollard Life Solutions is reinforcing its strategy in the underwritten segment as a specialised risk insurer.\n\nThis strategy focuses on providing specialised risk insurance premised on three main areas: business assurance, specialised product and underwriting, and wellness coaching.\n\nAccording to Poovan Perumal, head of product, pricing, and sales enablement at Hollard Life Solutions, one of the biggest challenges in the insurance market is that many providers aim to attract healthy clients, with incentives in place to only benefit individuals who stay fit and keep super healthy through rewards, premium discounts, and loyalty schemes. However, the reality is that not everyone can keep up, people are not superhuman. Hollard Life Solutions strategy moves away from this traditional thinking, recognising that we are dealing with unique individuals with real-life issues, and we need to help people to better manage health-related risks and help them enhance their overall quality of life in a way they are most comfortable with.\n\nTo support its strategy, Hollard Life Solutions has introduced Health Guru, a wellness coaching platform that provides its clients real-time access to personal health coaches to guide and support them in making changes that will make their health goals a reality. Also available is a wide range of informational reading material and videos that are suitably recommended based on the client's initial health vision of choice. This forms part of Hollard's new specialised risk insurer profile.\n\n\"Many South Africans are living with co-morbidities and underwriting them for insurance can be complex,\" says Perumal. \"It also requires levels of technical expertise to price them appropriately. While there is a lot of information available to help customers manage their health risks on their own, we want to provide them with convenient tools and support to enable them to achieve their health vision.\" Examples of such lives might include clients with diabetes or high BMI scores - Health Guru will provide such clients with wellness coaching to manage their conditions along the way, should they choose this as their health vision. Perumal believes that providing such support to higher-risk lives could help them lead a better quality of life and result in reduced risks of mortality and/or morbidity.\n\nAt its core, the Health Guru wellness coaching is forward-looking and acknowledges that each person's health and wellness journey is unique, and their needs and aspirations should be addressed individually. \"A central part of wellness coaching is customer empowerment, Perumal says.\n\n\"This is done in a very personalised manner, our wellness coaches are invested in supporting customers on their health and wellness journey, and provide them with the knowledge, tools, and support they need to make informed decisions about their health and wellness.\n\n\"In this process, policyholders, working with coaches, have someone to hold their hand on their wellness journey. There is no pressure for incentives, instead, this is a journey that recognises the individual's holistic circumstances, to help the customer navigate their health and wellness journey. We are embracing a customer-centric approach in wellness coaching, where the customer informs the journey and we are here to equip and guide the customer to reach the goals they have set for themselves,\" says Perumal.\n\nSteve Piper, Head of Underwritten Intermediary Sales at Hollard Life Solutions notes, \"One of the biggest challenges with severely impaired lives lies in finding mutually acceptable terms that are acceptable to the insured party's preferences while maintaining the insurer's comfort level of exposure to risk. In many cases, the looming and substantial risk of claims becomes so pronounced that the pricing necessary to cover such claims and related costs becomes financially burdensome.\"\n\nPiper adds that, while insurance fundamentally operates on the principle of risk pooling, which entails the distribution of risk, it is equally imperative to uphold fairness among the diverse groups of policyholders. \"Insurers strive to strike a balance by managing the extent of risk cross-subsidies in the overall book,\" he says. \"When it comes to underwriting these conditions for insurance purposes, the process can be intricate and demands a substantial level of technical proficiency to accurately determine appropriate pricing. Despite the abundant wealth of information accessible to help individuals in managing their health risk factors, the complexity of co-morbidities necessitates specialised expertise in the insurance sector.\"\n\nPiper explains that in striking a balance to address some of these challenges, Hollard has enhanced its underwriting processes to consider all available information and data to ensure that as many people as possible, who would not traditionally qualify for coverage with other insurers, are covered equally.\n\n\"We are leveraging automated underwriting tools that harness the power of machine learning to refine and constantly update our rules in line with real-life circumstances. In addition, we have also taken a decision to offer a deferred life underwriting option, to ensure that individuals can secure some form of coverage, even in cases where the market may have reservations about their insurability,\" says Piper.\n\n\"As we continue to navigate the digital age, without a doubt, product design will need to be more flexible, recognising the evolving nature of real-life circumstances,\" he concludes.",

                "body": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMartin Reynolds made headlines last January when a leaked email showed he had invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a \"bring your own booze\" party while Britain was in lockdown.\n\nAnd, hours before he is hauled before the official Covid Inquiry to answer questions on decision-making in Downing Street during the pandemic, the ex-principal private secretary to Boris Johnson looks set to make headilnes once again.\n\nDubbed \"Party Marty\" after details of the invite were leaked to ITV News, Mr Reynolds served as Mr Johnson's PPS from October 2019 to March 2022.\n\nHe will face inquiry chair Baroness Heather Hallett at 10.30am on Monday, with his evidence expected to include bombshell revelations from the heart of Downing Street's pandemic response.\n\nMr Reynolds had largely avoided the limelight before the emergence of his email, inviting colleagues to \"socially-distanced drinks\" during England's first coronavirus lockdown, despite being one of the most senior civil servants in Britain.\n\nThe former prime minister's top aides including controversial former chief of staff Dominic Cummings will also be grilled over decision-making in Downing Street during the pandemic.\n\nAlso appearing before the inquiry is former head of communications Lee Cain, who suggested \"the real person in charge\" as Covid raged was Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie.\n\nAs Mr Johnson's principal private secretary (PPS), he played a key role advising the prime minister on a wide range of issues.\n\nBefore joining the Foreign Office, he was a City lawyer.\n\nMr Johnson's former adviser Mr Cummings, who will appear at the inquiry on Tuesday, said the influence wielded by the principal private secretary within Downing Street was not widely appreciated.\n\n\"The PPS exercises far more influence and actual power over many issues than Cabinet ministers,\" Mr Cummings said.\n\n\"He can nudge policy, he can nudge vital appointments (real power). He can and does walk into the PM's office and exclude all political people 'on security grounds'.\"\n\nA leaked photograph of the prime minister and officials drinking in the No 10 garden on 15 May 2020 - five days before the \"bring your own booze\" event that Mr Reynolds invited colleagues to - showed the PPS sat at the same table as Mr Johnson.\n\nMr Cummings used a blog to defend the 15 May gathering, at which he was pictured at the same table as Mr Reynolds, the ex prime minister and his wife Carrie Johnson.\n\nHowever, he said a \"senior No10 official\" invited people to \"socially-distanced drinks\" in the garden on 20 May - an apparent reference to the email sent by Mr Reynolds.\n\nMr Cummings said that he and \"at least one other\" special adviser warned \"this seemed to be against the rules and should not happen\".\n\n\"In my opinion the official who organised this should anyway have been removed that summer because of his failures over Covid,\" Mr Cummings added.\n\n\"I said this repeatedly to the PM. The PM rejected my argument.\"\n\nMr Johnson attended the 20 May event, apologising before the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions and explaining, somewhat improbably, that he believed it had been a \"work event\" and not a party.\n\nHe was ridiculed for his trouble by opposition Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and the Partygate saga contributed to his eventual resignation.\n\nIn a scathing comment on the culture at No 10 under Mr Johnson's leadership, Partygate investigator and former senior civil servant Sue Gray said: \"Some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.\"\n\nHer report also revealed that the PM's birthday celebration is among a dozen gatherings being investigated by Scotland Yard, as is an alleged party in the prime minister's private flat.",

                "title": "Comelec reports faulty vote counting machines",
                "body": "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, October 30) - The Commision on Elections (Comelec) said a pilot area for computerized polls suffered delays over faulty vote counting machines (VCM) due to paper jam and overheating during the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE) on Monday.\n\nComelec said two VCM in a school in Dasmariñas, Cavite were recorded as faulty, something which was expected since the machines are old.\n\n\"Ay opo madaming hindi naman nasira pero nag-jam. Sakit na ng vote counting machines simula noong 2022 elections. Yun po talagang magjajam kasi nag-iinit kailangan ng electric fan, kailangan paypayan dahil nga po lumang luma ang mga makina na yan. Expected po yan,\" Comelec Chairman George Erwin Garcia told reporters.\n\n[Translation: Yes, there are many machines that got jammed but they are not broken. It's just the condition of these vote counting machines since the 2022 elections. Because of the paper jam and the overheating, so it needs an electric fan to cool off the old machines. These are expected.]\n\nGarcia said the glitch was expected since the units' final testing and sealing exhibited the same problems, but added that these were still deployed to compare with manual elections.\n\nHe also said Comelec still used faulty machines to show to the public that it needs to buy new units for the midterm election in 2025.\n\nGarcia said the paper jam can be solved by putting the paper again in the machine, while election results may be known after an hour compared to the longer time for manual checking.\n\nGarcia said Congress should allow early voting hours for seniors and persons with disability. He suggested extending the voting hours.\n\n\"At the same time, yung BSKE sana po mapag-isipan na ng ating kagalang-galang na Kongreso, gawing 7 to 5, hindi lang 7 to 3 o'clock lang. Kasi kapos po yung 3 o'clock siyempre po may boboto sa SK, may boboto sa barangay. Napakahaba po ng pila sa basât presinto,\" he said.\n\n[At the same time, for the BSKE, I hope the Congress will consider the 7am-5pm because the 7am-3pm is not enough to accommodate all of the voters for SK and Barangay. The queues are too long.]\n\nThe Comelec chief said candidates should submit Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) as failure to comply may be grounds for disqualification.\n\n\"Kung ito po ay pangalawang beses kayo hindi makakapag-file, hindi kayo nag-file nung 2018, hindi kayo nag-file ngayon, kayo po ay hindi na makakatakbo kahit kailan at hindi na rin kayo puwedeng ma-appoint sa kahit anong ahensya ng pamahalaan,\" Garcia said.\n\n[If this is their second time not to file, if they were not able to file in 2018 then were not able to again, they will not be able to run for the elections, they cannot be appointed in any agency in our government.]\n\nThe Comelec said it plans to issue an order for outgoing officials to properly turn over in at least one week the equipment and resources to the newly elected officials.\n\n\"Sa amin, ang role namin tumanggap ng SOCE at mag-issue ng certification. Pero yun pong transition napaka importante po yun. Sana pakiusap natin sa DILG na sana yung sinasabi nating issue ng transition. Kahit isang linggo lang para makahinga hinga lang. At the same time, makapagbigay ng turnover ng kagamitan,\" Garcia concluded.\n\n[Our role is to receive SOCE and issue certifications. The transition period is very important. We're asking the DILG to grant our request to at least have one week to turn these over to ease the situation and properly turnover the equipment.]",

                "body": "(Reuters) - Big media firms are expected to warn starting this week that studio revenues will slow in the coming quarters as dual Hollywood strikes left them with a thin release slate.\n\nWalt Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount - which together account for nearly half of Hollywood revenues - have delayed the release of films, including \"Dune: Part 2.\"\n\nThat leaves the studios with little to follow the third-quarter success of \"Barbenheimer\", with TD Cowen predicting that box-office revenue in the last three months of the year could be roughly a third lower than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAfter a strong November line up with \"The Marvels,\" \"Trolls Band Together\" and a \"Hunger Games\" prequel, big Christmas releases are few.\n\nThere is no obvious December blockbuster on the scale of \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" the highest-grossing film in 2022, or the 2021 hit \"Spider-Man: No Way Home.\"\n\nThe first dual work stoppage of writers and actors in 63 years has halted most productions since May. While the scribes began returning to work following a 148-day strike after reaching a deal with producers, it remains unclear when the actors would return.\n\nEven if a deal is reached with the actors soon, Wall Street does not expect a quick respite for the studios as it could take weeks for productions to resume.\n\nAnalysts expect studio revenues at Disney and Warner Bros Discovery to slow to 2.9% and 4.7% between October and December, while Paramount will likely post a drop of 1.9%, according to LSEG data.\n\nThat compares with third-quarter estimates for a rise of 4.4% at Disney, 12.5% at Warner Bros Discovery and 16.2% at Paramount.\n\n\"With the major media companies trying very hard to turn the direction of margins back in a positive direction, in part by raising price on OTT services, the potential for an extended dry period for new content carries serious risks,\" TD Cowen said.\n\nThe companies as well as Netflix have raised prices of their streaming services this year, betting that consumers will pay more or opt for cheaper, ad-supported services that are more lucrative for the business.\n\nNetflix, which makes many of its shows and movies overseas, reported earlier this month 9 million estimate-smashing subscriber additions in the September quarter and said it expected similar additions in the holiday period.\n\nHigher fees powered growth in streaming revenue - likely 6.9% at Warner Bros Discovery, 14.2% at Disney and 33% at Paramount - in the September quarter, potentially reducing losses at the money-losing Disney+ and Paramount+ services.\n\nCABLE TV PRESSURE\n\nMedia companies have long been grappling with a decline in cable TV. This has forced Disney to consider the sale of the assets that had long helped subsidize its streaming losses.\n\n\"The only bright spot is ESPN, which is the linchpin that holds the bundle together and viewership has stabilized over the last few years despite accelerated cord-cutting,\" said Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon of Disney, which he said has the largest exposure to traditional cable TV among the major media companies.\n\nDisney has said it will break out sports programming revenue from the holiday quarter, and earlier this month disclosed declining sales and profit at ESPN, for which CEO Bob Iger has signaled he wants to find a partner to help create a streaming service.\n\nDisney is expected to report its fifth straight quarterly decline in linear TV revenue, a fall of 3.8%. Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount are expected to see declines of 5.4% each in their cable TV businesses.\n\nOverall revenue at Disney is expected to rise 6%, Warner Bros Discovery to inch 2.1% higher and Paramount to grow 2.8%.\n\nParamount will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 2, while Disney and Warner Bros Discovery are slated for Nov. 8.\n\n(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Writing by Aditya Soni; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)",

                "body": "Oct 30 (Reuters) - 3D metal-printing startup Seurat Technologies on Monday hinted at potentially going public in the medium-term and said it had raised $99 million in a funding round co-led by chip designer Nvidia's venture capital arm.\n\nWith the latest series C funding round, the company's valuation will approach $350 million, said a source who asked not to be named.\n\n\"I expect that (going public) is in our cards ... 12-18 months is the earliest we would consider that ... potentially more like 24 or 36,\" Seurat CEO James DeMuth told Reuters in an interview, adding that proceeds from the financing round will be used to deploy its production printers.\n\nThe fundraise, co-led by Nvidia's NVentures and Capricorn's Technology Impact Fund, brought in new investors Honda Motor and Cubit Capital. Existing backers including Porsche and venture capital units of Xerox Holdings and General Motors Co also participated.\n\nSeurat is looking to bring parts manufacturing, with its green energy-powered Area Printing technology, closer to customer factories around the world in a bid to reshore supply chains and slash emissions.\n\nOver the past couple of years, companies across industries globally have been looking to diversify supply chains to reduce their dependence on China to address business continuity concerns and as U.S.-Sino trade tensions heat up.\n\n\"Seurat's local factory deployment model provides the industry with a solution to near-shore manufacturing and to increase the resiliency of supply chains,\" said existing investor Porsche Automobil Holding's board member Lutz Meschke.\n\nSeurat also has commitments to supply 59 tons of metal components for Siemens Energy's turbines over a six-year period and the startup said earlier this month that it had received letters of intent from global manufacturers exceeding capacity of its pilot factory in Massachusetts.\n\nThe company said it had letters of intent from six customers totaling 4,000 tons of material, setting it up for $750 million in revenue over several years.

Among the guests were a number of ambassadors and re­p­re­sen­ta­ti­ves from many of the 175 IMO member countries.\n\nAnne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping, emphasized that Denmark, known as a green pioneer, also in shipping, will work hard to achieve the necessary results so that global shipping can meet the ambitious goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050.\n\nAs a representative of one of the world's largest merchant fleets, I can only warmly recommend that Denmark continues as a member of the IMO Council - we can and should make a difference there\n\nAnne H.

This requires important decisions and intense and constructive cooperation within IMO. Here, I am confident that Denmark will take the lead and contribute to getting everyone on board,\" says Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of the Danish Shipowners Association.\n\nShipping is global. IMO is an important forum for discussions about the safety of our seafarers, vital supply chains, and cross-border challenges such as shipping emissions and pollution. It is crucial to have rules that are the same for everyone.\n\n\"Denmark is a quality shipping nation, and we have a strong interest in ensuring that the IMO serves as the global focal point for the regulation of shipping. In this context, it is essential that the IMO operates efficiently and has up-to-date strategies.

                "title": "Air Canada Reports Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results",
                "body": "\"Air Canada performed strongly in the third quarter, generating solid operating revenues of more than $6.3 billion, a 19 per cent increase over the same period last year. Our focus on growing our international network, building scale at our hubs and leveraging our solid partnerships is delivering strong results. Our operating income reached $1.4 billion, more than double from a year ago, and adjusted EBITDA grew by $773 million to $1.83 billion, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 29 per cent. I thank our employees and management team for their hard work in safely transporting 12.6 million customers during the busy and demanding summer season. We managed costs prudently, with operating expenses rising 5 per cent, on a 10 per cent increase in capacity. We have continued to pay down debt in the quarter, lowering our leverage ratio to 1.4 from 5.1 at the end of last year, while also maintaining a healthy level of liquidity, which stood at nearly $10 billion at the quarter's end,\" said Michael Rousseau, President and Chief Executive Officer at Air Canada.\n\n\"Viewed sequentially, Air Canada's progressive performance to date proves the success of its strategy to grow back the airline and improve operational stability, while mitigating risks. This requires navigating geopolitical uncertainty, inflation and the volatile fuel price environment, meeting increased competition and dealing with supply chain, and the evolving regulatory environment. Yet our demonstrated adaptability, combined with a stable demand environment, give us every confidence for the rest of the year and into 2024 despite the inevitable headwinds to which our global industry is prone. We will continue to manage our business with diligence. We remain confident with our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and at this point in time, expect to land in the higher range of our full year guidance.\"\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Air Canada plans to increase its ASM capacity by about 10 per cent from the same quarter in 2022. Air Canada is providing the following update for the full year 2023 guidance as described below.\n\nAir Canada made assumptions in preparing its updated guidance and making forward looking statements -- including moderate Canadian GDP growth for 2023, that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.35 per U.S. dollar for the full year 2023 and that the price of jet fuel will average C$1.13 per litre for the full year 2023.\n\nAir Canada is modifying its 2023 adjusted CASM guidance to reflect the change in full year ASM capacity guidance, as well as adjustments to various expense items related to the ongoing cost environment.\n\nAir Canada is not updating its 2024 targets at this time and will continue evaluating them as it progresses with its plans and executes on its strategic priorities.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nBelow is a description of certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used by Air Canada to provide readers with additional information on its financial and operating performance. Such measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\n\nAdjusted CASM\n\nAir Canada uses adjusted CASM to assess the operating and cost performance of its ongoing airline business without the effects of aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations, impairment of assets and freighter costs as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis across periods less meaningful and their exclusion generally allows for a more meaningful analysis of Air Canada's operating expense performance and a more meaningful comparison to that of other airlines.\n\nIn calculating adjusted CASM, aircraft fuel expense is excluded from operating expense results as it fluctuates widely, depending on many factors, including international market conditions, geopolitical events, jet fuel refining costs and Canada/U.S. currency exchange rates. Air Canada also incurs expenses related to ground packages at Air Canada Vacations, which some airlines, without comparable tour operator businesses, may not incur. In addition, these costs do not generate ASMs and, therefore, excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison across periods when such costs may vary.\n\nAir Canada also incurs expenses related to the operation of freighter aircraft that some airlines, without comparable cargo businesses, may not incur. Air Canada had six Boeing 767 dedicated freighter aircraft in its operating fleet as at September 30, 2023, compared to two Boeing 767 dedicated freighter aircraft in service as at September 30, 2022. These costs do not generate ASMs and, therefore, excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison of the passenger airline business across periods.\n\nAdjusted CASM is reconciled to GAAP operating expense as follows:\n\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to assess operating results before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets. In calculating adjusted EBITDA, Air Canada excludes impairment of assets as this may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis across periods or to other airlines less meaningful.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of operating revenues) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to assess the operating margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets.\n\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are reconciled to GAAP operating income (loss) as follows:\n\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss) is used by Air Canada to assess the overall pre-tax financial performance of its business without the effects of impairment of assets, foreign exchange gains or losses, net interest relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on the sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis across periods or to other airlines less meaningful.\n\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss) is reconciled to GAAP income (loss) before income taxes as follows:\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Diluted\n\nAir Canada uses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share -- diluted as a means to assess the overall financial performance of its business without the after-tax effects of impairment of assets, foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on the sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, and gains or losses on disposal of assets as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful.\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share are reconciled to GAAP net income as follows:\n\nThe table below reflects the share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted earnings per share basis:\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by Air Canada as an indicator of the financial strength and performance of its business, indicating how much cash it can generate from operations after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash flows from operating activities minus additions to property, equipment, and intangible assets, net of proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions. Such measure is not a recognized measure for financial statement presentation under GAAP, does not have a standardized meaning, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\n\nThe table below reconciles free cash flow to net cash flows from (used in) operating activities for the periods indicated.\n\nNet debt is a capital management measure and a key component of the capital managed by Air Canada and provides management with a measure of its net indebtedness. It refers to total long-term debt liabilities (including current portion) less cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments.\n\nNet Debt to Trailing 12-Month Adjusted EBITDA (Leverage Ratio)\n\nNet debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio (also referred to as \"leverage ratio\") is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to measure financial leverage. Leverage ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.\n\nFor further information on Air Canada's public disclosure file, including Air Canada's 2022 Annual Information Form, dated March 29, 2023, consult SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nThird Quarter 2023 Conference Call\n\nAir Canada will host its quarterly analysts' call today, Monday, October 30, 2023, at 8:00 a.m. ET.

                "body": "The previous administration under Bello Matawalle initiated a project to construct and furnish Governor's lodges in all the 14 local government areas of the state.\n\nZamfara State Government has released documents showing how former Governor and Minister of State for Defence, Bello Matawalle, approved 100% payment of over one billion naira for fencing, landscaping, and furnishing of Governor's lodges in 14 local government areas even before the projects began.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu announced the appointment of Mattawalle as the Minister of State for Defence in August but his appointment was condemned by a cross-section of Zamfara residents, who described the governor as a failure.\n\nThe previous administration under Bello Matawalle initiated a project to construct and furnish Governor's lodges in all the 14 local government areas of the state.\n\nIn a statement issued in Gusau on Sunday, the spokesperson for the Zamfara Governor, Sulaiman Bala Idris, noted that the documents expose a series of violations of public service rules by the previous government of Matawalle.\n\nAccording to him, Governor Dauda Lawal's administration revealed Matawalle's financial recklessness so that the public would be aware. It noted that 100% of funds were withdrawn and disbursed for projects that were abandoned.\n\nThe statement read in part: \"It is against the public service rules to make full payment for a project that has not yet commenced; there are processes and guidelines which were intentionally not adhered to. We must hold accountable those who award and pay for suspicious contracts and recover what rightfully belongs to the people of Zamfara.\n\n\"Among such projects initiated by the past government of Bello Matawalle is the construction, fencing, landscaping, furnishing, and external electrification for the Governor's Lodge in each Local Government Area.\n\n\"It is important to note that the amount of funds allocated and disbursed for the construction of each lodge varied, and different contractors were assigned to execute the projects. However, it is ironic that some contractors received full payment before the project even began, while the majority received over 90% payment.\n\n\"The released documents reveal how Bello Matawalle authorised the payment of ₦1,966,035,160.00 to BES BELMON Nigeria Limited on the 27th of December 2021 for the fencing, landscaping, furnishing, and external electrification of the Governor's Lodge, which is still under construction across the 14 Local Governments Areas.\n\n\"Contractors were paid 100% upfront in Kauran Namoda, Zurmi, Bakura, Maradun, Bukkuyum, Bungudu, and Gummi before the projects started.\n\n\"The past administration of Bello Matawalle on the 30th of April 2020 has made a total payment of ₦324,410,211.00 to SWAT AGA Construction Limited for the construction of the Governor's lodge in Kauran Namoda. The payment was disbursed from the Ministry for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, and a payment voucher carrying the date and details has been released.\n\n\"Furthermore, we present more vouchers exposing total payments of another ₦324,410,211.00 on the 30th of April 2020 to SWAT AGA for constructing a Governor's lodge in Zurmi Local Government Area.\n\n\"It is disheartening to uncover how the same BES BELMON Nig. Limited that was paid 100% for furnishing a yet-to-be-constructed 14 lodges received ₦323,492,050. 00 on the 30th of April 2020 to construct a Governor's Lodge in Bakura Local Government Area; also, another full payment of ₦323,492,050.00 on the same 30th of April 2020 to build a Governor's lodge in Maradun Local Government Area.\n\n\"The public should take note of BES BELMON Nig. Limited and its apparent connivance in violation of established public service rules. Bello Matawalle approved another payment of ₦323,492,050.00 on the 30th of April 2020 to BES BELMON to construct the Governor's Lodge in Bukkuyum Local Government Area. The intriguing question is, who owns this firm?\n\n\"Moreover, on the 30th of April 2020, Bello Mohammed Matawalle approved yet another 100% payment of ₦323,492,050.00 to BES BELMON to construct the Governor's Lodge in Bungudu Local Government Area.\n\n\"The Zamfara State Government will continue to expose financial banditry and malpractices committed by the previous administration in the interest of transparency.\n\n\"Our government is committed to rescuing, reforming and rebuilding Zamfara. As part of this mission, we consider it an obligation to expose financial recklessness and ensure justice prevails. As such, we call on BES BELMON Nig. Limited to IMMEDIATELY return the sum of ₦1,966,035,160.00 to the State Government, which was illegally and criminally withdrawn from the State's treasury and disbursed to the firm.\"",

                "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures climbed on Monday as tensions in the Middle East failed to dampen investor sentiment ahead of a busy week full of earnings reports and an interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve.\n\nIsraeli troops stepped up ground operations in Gaza early on Monday, with Palestinians in the enclave reporting fierce air and artillery strikes as the conflict entered its fourth week.\n\nHowever, the clashes had little impact on U.S. stock markets, with megacap growth names such as Nvidia, Amazon.com and Tesla up between 0.9% and 1.6% in premarket trading.\n\n\"The ground offensive in Gaza will still be causing some concern, but it has been largely expected and that's why I don't think you've seen any kind of particularly adverse reaction on the markets today,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\"In the United States, the emphasis has returned to the resilience within the U.S. economy and that being a good thing rather than as an indicator that there could be a rate hike.\"\n\nGeopolitical concerns as well as a surge in Treasury yields have weighed on U.S. equities this month, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down over 10% from its intraday high in July.\n\nOn Monday, the yield on the ten-year note was at 4.86%, after having breached the 5% level earlier this month.\n\nAdding to bond market worries, the U.S. Treasury is likely to boost the size of auctions for bills, notes, and bonds in the fourth quarter when it announces its financing plans this week to fund a worsening budget deficit. A subsequent rise in yields may further pressure stocks.\n\nWith inflation gradually easing in the United States, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of its policy meeting on Nov. 1, according to the CME Group's Fedwatch tool.\n\nHowever, certain parts of the economy have proved to be resilient, spurring concerns that the central bank could signal willingness to hold rates at their current level for longer than previously anticipated.\n\nA fresh batch of data on the U.S. economy this week, ending with the October's non-farm payrolls report on Friday, will be on the watchlist for further cues on the Fed's monetary policy path.\n\nInvestors also await quarterly results from companies including McDonald's, Apple, Pfizer and Eli Lilly, with the third-quarter earnings season having reached the halfway point.\n\nAt 5:22 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 178 points, or 0.55%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 29 points, or 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 123.5 points, or 0.87%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Coherus Biosciences jumped 15.2% in premarket trade as the U.S. health regulator approved the company's treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar; Editing by Maju Samuel)",

                "title": "Lithium Stocks: Why Albemarle Is a Nothing-but-Trouble Play to Avoid",
                "body": "Albemarle is in the news because of a failed lithium-project takeover.\n\nAn indirect but interesting way to invest in the electric vehicle (EV) boom is through shares of high-conviction lithium miners. Thus, you may have heard about multinational specialty chemical and lithium company Albermarle (NYSE:ALB), but we definitely don't consider it to be high-conviction. Indeed, we're seeing major issues with ALB stock and can only give it a \"D\" grade right now.\n\nWe'll acknowledge that Albemarle has been in the financial headlines recently. That's not necessarily a good thing, though. The old adage that \"there's no such thing as bad press\" probably doesn't apply to Albemarle in 2023.\n\nOn Sept. 26, we issued a warning about ALB stock, when it traded at $163 and Albemarle's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio was approximately 5x. Our concern was that value-focused investors might assume that Albemarle shares were a bargain.\n\nJust because shares have gone down in price, doesn't always mean they're a bargain. The Albemarle share price had been on a steep downtrend since February, and staying out of the way was the best policy.\n\nIn late October, ALB stock fell below $140 and Albemarle's P/E ratio was slightly above 4x. As it turned out, Albemarle's shares weren't a good value; they were just a value trap.\n\nWe tried to warn people about Albemarle's problems. The company was in the financial press, but not for something positive.\n\nSpecifically, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported that Albemarle paid more than $218 million to settle a foreign bribery probe. This settlement was to \"resolve possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\"; this doesn't sound like positive public relations for Albemarle.\n\nMore recently, Albemarle ended up in the financial headlines again, this time in The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. First, we'll provide some background info. For a while, some investors and commentators had been buzzing about Albemarle's proposal to acquire Australia-based mining company Liontown Resources (OTCMKTS:LINRF).\n\nThis could have been a value-added acquisition for Albemarle. Yet, it wasn't to be. The Bloomberg headline spoke loudly and clearly: \"Liontown Dives 35% After Bid Collapse, Emergency Fund Raising.\"\n\nIt's probably not positive press coverage if the headline uses the word \"collapse.\" Apparently, mining tycoon Gina Rinehart stepped in and made a competing offer that Liontown couldn't refuse. That's undoubtedly disappointing to some of Albemarle's shareholders. Yet, it's an unfortunate reality for Albemarle, even if it's perfectly fine with Rinehart and Liontown Resources.\n\nThere are plenty of EV materials stocks out there in 2023. Why add so much risk to your portfolio with a stock that's on a steep downtrend, representing a company with less-than-ideal press coverage?\n\nIn the world of mining stocks, the risk level is elevated and you should only select the best while avoiding the rest. Clearly, Albemarle fits into the \"rest\" category, not the \"best\" category. So, in the final analysis, ALB stock only earns a \"D\" grade and investors shouldn't be too eager to buy it now.",

                "body": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\nOct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures climbed on Monday as tensions in the Middle East failed to dampen investor sentiment ahead of a busy week full of earnings reports and an interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve.\n\nIsraeli troops stepped up ground operations in Gaza early on Monday, with Palestinians in the enclave reporting fierce air and artillery strikes as the conflict entered its fourth week.\n\nHowever, the clashes had little impact on U.S. stock markets, with megacap growth names such as Nvidia, Amazon.com and Tesla up between 0.9% and 1.6% in premarket trading.\n\n\"The ground offensive in Gaza will still be causing some concern, but it has been largely expected and that's why I don't think you've seen any kind of particularly adverse reaction on the markets today,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\"In the United States, the emphasis has returned to the resilience within the U.S. economy and that being a good thing rather than as an indicator that there could be a rate hike.\"\n\nGeopolitical concerns as well as a surge in Treasury yields have weighed on U.S. equities this month, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down over 10% from its intraday high in July.\n\nOn Monday, the yield on the ten-year note was at 4.86%, after having breached the 5% level earlier this month.\n\nAdding to bond market worries, the U.S. Treasury is likely to boost the size of auctions for bills, notes, and bonds in the fourth quarter when it announces its financing plans this week to fund a worsening budget deficit. A subsequent rise in yields may further pressure stocks.\n\nWith inflation gradually easing in the United States, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of its policy meeting on Nov. 1, according to the CME Group's Fedwatch tool.\n\nHowever, certain parts of the economy have proved to be resilient, spurring concerns that the central bank could signal willingness to hold rates at their current level for longer than previously anticipated.\n\nA fresh batch of data on the U.S. economy this week, ending with the October's non-farm payrolls report on Friday, will be on the watchlist for further cues on the Fed's monetary policy path.\n\nInvestors also await quarterly results from companies including McDonald's, Apple, Pfizer and Eli Lilly, with the third-quarter earnings season having reached the halfway point.\n\nAt 5:22 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 178 points, or 0.55%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 29 points, or 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 123.5 points, or 0.87%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Coherus Biosciences jumped 15.2% in premarket trade as the U.S. health regulator approved the company's treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer.

                "title": "CNA FINANCIAL ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2023 NET INCOME OF $0.95 PER SHARE AND CORE INCOME OF $1.06 PER SHARE",
                "body": "CHICAGO, Oct. 30, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- CNA Financial Corporation (NYSE: CNA) today announced third quarter 2023 net income of $258 million, or $0.95 per share, versus net loss of $42 million, or $(0.15) per share, in the prior year quarter. Net investment losses for the quarter were $31 million compared to $85 million in the prior year quarter. Core income for the quarter was $289 million, or $1.06 per share, versus $43 million, or $0.16 per share, in the prior year quarter.\n\nOur Property & Casualty segments produced core income of $351 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $91 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher net investment income, record high pretax underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses. P&C segments, excluding third party captives, generated gross written premium growth of 7% and net written premium growth of 6% for the third quarter of 2023 driven by renewal premium change of +6%, including rate of +5% and exposure change of +1%.\n\nOur Life & Group segment produced a core loss of $29 million for the third quarter of 2023 versus $192 million in the prior year quarter, which reflects an unfavorable after-tax impact of $2 million in 2023 and $143 million in 2022 as a result of the annual reserve reviews.\n\nOur Corporate & Other segment produced a core loss of $33 million for the third quarter of 2023 versus $25 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nCNA Financial declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, payable November 30, 2023 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2023.\n\n\"We continued to produce very strong results with a significant increase in core income driven by a 31% increase in net investment income, record levels of P&C underlying underwriting gain, lower levels of catastrophe loss, and improved results in Life & Group. Our annual Life and Group reserve assumption review resulted in a neutral change this year compared to a $143 million after-tax loss last year. Excluding the impacts of the Life & Group reserve review, our core income was still up by 56% this quarter.\n\nP&C core income was up 35% in the quarter driven by higher investment income, and $220 million of underlying underwriting income. The all-in combined ratio was 94.3% with pretax catastrophe losses of $94 million or 4.1 points, and 0.2 points of favorable prior period development. The P&C underlying combined ratio was 90.4%.\n\nWe recorded 7% growth in gross written premium ex captives and 6% growth in net written premium. Our overall rate change remained stable at 5%, and importantly, rates improved in our casualty lines most impacted by social inflation, and rate turned positive in Specialty as decreases in management liability pricing moderated in the quarter. We are encouraged by these trends as we continue to cover our long run loss cost trends from written rate increases together with the exposure increases that act like rate, and we are confident in our ability to continue to leverage the favorable market conditions,\" said Dino E. Robusto, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of CNA Financial Corporation.\n\nCore loss improved $163 million for the third quarter of 2023 as compared with the prior year quarter. Both periods are inclusive of assumption updates as a result of the annual reserve reviews. Results for the prior year quarter have been adjusted to reflect the application of the LDTI accounting standard and include an unfavorable impact from reserve assumption updates in 2022.\n\nThe assumption updates in the third quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted core loss by $2 million after- tax, which is comprised of an $8 million increase in long term care reserves, partially offset by a $6 million reduction in structured settlement reserves.\n\nAdjusted to reflect the application of the LDTI accounting standard, assumption updates in the third quarter of 2022 unfavorably impacted core loss by $143 million after-tax. The 2022 assumption updates included an $186 million increase in long term care reserves, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of increased cost of care inflation offset by favorable premium rate action assumptions. In addition, favorable assumption updates resulted in a $5 million reduction in structured settlement reserves.\n\nCorporate & Other\n\nCore loss increased $8 million for the third quarter of 2023 as compared with the prior year quarter driven by unfavorable net prior year loss reserve development partially offset by higher net investment income. The current quarter includes a $16 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior year development largely associated with legacy mass tort claims compared with no charge in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nNet Investment Income\n\nNet investment income increased $131 million for the third quarter of 2023 as compared with the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by a $72 million increase in income from limited partnership and common stock investments and a $59 million increase in income from fixed income securities and other investments.\n\nStockholders' Equity\n\nStockholders' equity of $8.6 billion was consistent with year-end 2022. Book value per share ex AOCI of $45.43 increased 7% from year-end 2022 adjusting for $2.46 of dividends per share. As of September 30, 2023, statutory capital and surplus for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies was $10.6 billion.\n\nAccounting Standards Update\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, Financial Services-Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (LDTI). The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the measurement and disclosure of long-duration contracts. For the Company, this includes the run-off long term care business in the Life & Group segment. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2023, using the modified retrospective method applied as of the transition date of January 1, 2021. All prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect application of the new guidance. While the requirements of the new guidance represent a material change from legacy accounting, the new guidance does not impact capital and surplus under statutory accounting practices, cash flows or the underlying economics of the business. Additional information regarding the Company's adoption of ASU 2018-12 and the impact to historical financial results is contained in the Company's Q1 2023 Financial Supplement, furnished on Form 8-K, on May 1, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nCNA is one of the largest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurance companies.

Lindquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CNA Financial Corporation and other members of senior management.

The call will also be broadcast live on the internet and may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the CNA website (www.cna.com). A presentation will be posted and available on the CNA website that will provide additional insight into the results.\n\nThe call is available to the media, but questions will be restricted to investors and the professional investment community. An online replay will be available on CNA's website following the call. Financial supplement information related to the results is available on the investor relations pages of the CNA website or by contacting investor.relations@cna.com.\n\nManagement utilizes the following metrics in their evaluation of the Property & Casualty Operations.\n\nThese ratios are calculated using financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in t he United States of America (GAAP).\n\nRenewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes.\n\nRate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. For certain products within Small Business, where quantifiable, rate includes the influence of new business as well.\n\nExposure represents the measure of risk used in the pricing of the insurance product. The change in exposure represents the change in premium dollars on policies that renew as a result of the change in risk of the policy.\n\nRetention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed, excluding rate and exposure changes, in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew.\n\nNew business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.\n\nGross written premiums ex. 3rd party captives represents gross written premiums excluding business which is ceded to third party captives, including business related to large warranty programs.\n\nDevelopment-related items represents net prior year loss reserve and premium development, and includes the effects of interest accretion and change in allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and deductible amounts.\n\nUnderwriting gain (loss) represents net earned premiums less total insurance expenses, which includes insurance claims and policyholders' benefits, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other insurance related expenses, pre-tax.\n\nUnderlying underwriting gain (loss) represents underwriting results excluding catastrophe losses and development-related items.\n\nStatutory capital and surplus represents the excess of an insurance company's admitted assets over its liabilities, including loss reserves, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Statutory capital and surplus as of the current period is preliminary.\n\nThe Company's investment portfolio is monitored by management through analysis of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities, portfolio duration and exposure to market and credit risk.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\n\nThis press release also contains financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP. Management utilizes these financial measures to monitor the Company's insurance operations and investment portfolio. The Company believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures follow below.\n\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Core Income (Loss)\n\nCore income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of net investment gains or losses. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net investment gains or losses because net investment gains or losses are generall y driven by economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of our primary operations. Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share to Core Income (Loss) per Diluted Share\n\nCore income (loss) per diluted share provides management and investors with a valuable measure of the Company's operating performance for the same reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core income (loss). Core income (loss) per diluted share is core income (loss) on a per diluted share basis.\n\nReconciliation of Book Value per Share to Book Value per Share Excluding AOCI\n\nBook value per share excluding AOCI allows management and investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes this measurement is useful as it reduces the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.\n\nCalculation of Return on Equity and Core Return on Equity\n\nCore return on equity provides management and investors with a measure of how effectively the Company is investing the portion of the Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to its business operations.\n\nFor additional information, please refer to CNA's most recent 10-K on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the financial supplement, available at www.cna.com.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes statements that relate to anticipated future events (forward-looking statements) rather than actual present conditions or historical events.

                "title": "Parts of Cape Town to see water supply disruptions this week",
                "body": "The City of Cape Town's water and sanitation directorate has advised that various areas will experience water supply disruptions this week as the team conducts planned work on its water supply infrastructure.\n\nResidents in affected areas are advised that water supplies may be disrupted and are encouraged to plan ahead for alternative water supply arrangements during this time.\n\nAlso read: Summer is coming: City announces swimming pool operations\n\nZero-pressure tests (ZPT) and conditional assessments:\n\nPlumstead and Wynberg\n\nThe directorate said conditional assessments are currently being done on the water supply network in these areas and will continue until Thursday, 30 November. This will result in the possibility of lower-than-usual pressure experienced for up to 1.5 hours during the day in some parts as the assessments progress.\n\nThe City explained that conditional testing, on the other hand, ensures that the pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) in the water supply network are operating effectively and managing the pressures at the determined settings to preserve the lifespan of the pipeline and reduce the occurrence of water wastage resulting from pipe bursts.\n\nAs a result, some residents may experience pressure fluctuations. The City added that pressure fluctuations will be minimised as much as possible.\n\nLynn's View (lower area), Somerset West\n\nZero-pressure testing will be conducted on the water supply network in these areas.\n\nHout Bay, Scott Estate, Chapman's Peak and Baviaanskloof\n\nZero-pressure testing will be conducted on the water supply network in these areas\n\nDie Wingerd, Greenway Rise, Stuart's Hill, Martinville (Bizweni - Somerset West)\n\nZero-pressure testing will be done on the water supply network in these areas.\n\nThe City also explained that zero-pressure testing and step-testing are done in advance as part of the installation process for its pressure management technology. These tests are conducted to see if any unmapped inflows need to be considered before installing smart pressure-reducing valves.\n\nAs a result, some residents in these affected areas may experience low water pressure, while other residents may experience no water supply during the testing period.\n\n'It is not possible to predict which areas or streets will experience disruptions,' added City. 'Managing water pressure more effectively reduces the possibility of pipe bursts and water wastage.'\n\nCape {town} Etc discount: Find solace in the city with the ultimate City Girl Experience for two people at Cloud 9 Boutique Hotel for R2 999 (Valued at R3 605). Get it here.\n\nMaintenance work: pipe and valve installations, repairs and replacements:\n\nHout Bay\n\nThe water supply to various roads in this area will be shut off intermittently during this period to enable the directorate's maintenance team to safely conduct valve replacements and fire hydrant upgrades.\n\nThe City said notices indicated the dates of the affected roads will be circulated in advance and advised residents to keep their taps closed on the day to prevent water loss and/or damage when the water supply is restored.\n\nNorthern parts of the city: Durbanville, Kraaifontein, Bloekombos, Wallacedene, Joostenbergvlakte and Bellville\n\nThe Wemmershoek Water Treatment Plant will be shut down for maintenance. Residents in these areas are advised to reduce their water consumption during this period.\n\nLarge part of Gordon's Bay (Dobson)\n\nThe water supply to a large part of Gordon's Bay bounded by Sir Lowry's Pass Road, Dennehoek Road, Disa Road and the coastline will be shut off to enable the maintenance team to conduct a tie-in on the main water supply to the area.\n\nThe City says careful consideration has been given to the planning of this work to ensure it is being done at a time that is least disruptive to the water supply.\n\nHowever, maintenance work can sometimes be more complex than anticipated, resulting in longer-than-expected periods of water supply disruptions.\n\nAdditionally, all sites where water and sanitation repairs and upgrades are conducted are deemed to be construction sites and, as such, are off-limits to members of the public.\n\nThe City advises that for a short period after the water supply is restored, the water may be discoloured or milky in appearance due to the presence of trapped air in the pipes. If left to stand, the water will become clear in colour again.\n\nResidents are encouraged to keep taps closed to prevent any water loss and/or damage, as well as store enough water in clean, sealed containers to last during this period.\n\nExplore Cape Town and its surroundings with these incredible car deals for under 100k.

                "body": "Kasikorn Bank, a major bank in Thailand, has acquired the parent company of Satang Corporation Co. Ltd., which provides Bitcoin and crypto services.\n\nReports suggest that Kasikorn Bank, or K-Bank, recently announced its successful acquisition of 97% of the parent company of Satang Corporation Co. Ltd., a company offering digital asset exchange services. The deal amounted to a substantial 3.705 billion Thai baht (approximately $102.8 million) and became effective on October 27th. Additionally, this deal led to the establishment of a new K-Bank subsidiary named Unita Capital, which is one of the pioneers in the Asian acquisition market for digital asset firms.\n\nUpon completion of the deal, Satang plans to rebrand itself as Orbix. The newly formed entity will include three significant subsidiary companies: Orbix Invest (a digital asset fund manager), Orbix Custodian, and Orbix Technology. Orbix Technology is a blockchain technology developer and custodian.\n\nEarlier this year, K-Bank revealed its plans to secure $100 million in funding while emphasizing the need to target Web3, fintech, and artificial intelligence development. Udomsak Rakwongwan, a professor at Kasetsart University and a co-founder of FWX.finance, stated that K-Bank has upped its game in the cryptocurrency industry and stands on par with one of its major competitors, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB).\n\nK-Bank's primary objective is to provide a comprehensive range of authorized crypto-related services in Thailand. FWX is a decentralized derivatives platform built on EVM-based chains, and K-Bank is one of the project's key investors. Furthermore, K-Bank has already obtained a cryptocurrency exchange license and aims to acquire the remaining licenses.\n\nEarlier this year, Thailand announced its plans to revamp income tax laws related to earnings from abroad by 2024. With new tax reforms and law implementation plans scheduled for 2025, the country is demonstrating a welcoming and favorable stance towards crypto.\n\nAdditionally, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, successfully obtained a Digital Asset Operator license in Thailand. Binance established a company named Gulf Binance in partnership with Gulf Innova Co. Ltd. in May of this year.",

                "body": "HSBC will hand more than $3bn (£2.5bn) to shareholders, after higher interest rates helped to more than double quarterly profits, despite taking a financial hit on China's property crisis.\n\nThe London-headquartered bank said it was launching the share buyback, and pay a dividend worth 10 cents a share, after what its chief executive, Noel Quinn, hailed as \"three consecutive quarters of strong financial performance\".\n\nThe move came as HSBC revealed it had made $7.7bn in pre-tax profits between July and September. While it fell short of average analyst forecasts for $8.1bn, it was more than double the $3.2bn it made during the same period last year.\n\nThe profits were supported by a 15% rise in net interest income, which accounts for the difference between what it charges for loans and mortgages, against what it pays out to savers.\n\nRelated: China's Country Garden risks default after 'missing bond payment'\n\nIt helped offset the $1.1bn that HSBC put aside to cover potential defaults. That includes $500m linked to China's struggling commercial property market, where HSBC - which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia - has a $13.6bn exposure.\n\nHSBC bosses said that while the Chinese property market was unlikely to get much worse, the recovery process would be slow.\n\n\"The summer developments have been somewhat worse than we anticipated earlier in the year, right after the Covid lockdown,\" said Georges Elhedery, chief financial officer.\n\n\"Looking forward, I think we are expecting still a couple of quarters of difficulty as the sector adjusts. We are definitely encouraged by the ongoing policy measures that have been taken to ease the pressure on the sector, and to allow it to get through this challenge,\" he said.\n\nHSBC's shares rose by 1.1% on Monday morning.\n\nThe rise comes days after banking rival Standard Chartered shares tumbled more than 11%, on news that its pre-tax profits more than halved due to its exposure to China. Its earnings were knocked by a $186m hit on China's property sector and having to write down the value of its investments in China Bohai Bank.\n\n\"After seeing Standard Chartered take an unexpected impairment last week relating to its China assets, [HSBC's] credit losses were under a microscope,\" said Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nBut HSBC's loan charges were ultimately in line with expectations, providing some relief for investors who will also be cheering the jump in payouts.\n\n\"There's still a cloud of uncertainty hovering over the market, but investors will be happy to see no nasty surprises,\" Britzman said.",

                "title": "Major Drug Test Supplier To Stop Testing for Cannabis, Prioritize Fentanyl | High Times",
                "body": "America has inched one step closer to a day where employees may no longer have to fear getting stoned after their shift.\n\nA major supplier of drug testing kits has announced an updated screening panel which no longer tests for cannabis and prioritizes testing for fentanyl.\n\nPsychemedics, a Massachusetts-based producer of drug testing kits announced Friday that they would be launching a new five-panel drug screen which will \"[shift] the spotlight from marijuana to the paramount threat of fentanyl\" amid a nationally changing legislative landscape with regard to cannabis laws and continually skyrocketing rates of fentanyl overdose.\n\nPsychemedics, which by their own admission manufactured the first commercially viable hair test for the presence of drugs in 1986, said Friday that the way drug tests are currently performed are outdated and do not address the needs of employers or employees. Current drug tests are also not great at detecting fentanyl compared to traditional opioids, according to Psychemedics.\n\n\"As we grapple with an ongoing labor shortage and with marijuana's legal landscape evolving in 49 states, it's clear that the time for a change has come. Traditional 5-panel drug tests, rooted in a four-decade-old paradigm, have failed to evolve in today's drug market and are unable to detect the rising drug, fentanyl,\" Psychemedics said in a press release.\n\nPsychemedics drug tests, which use hair as opposed to urine, are also reportedly much more effective than the urine tests at detecting other drugs besides cannabis as well. According to the press release, the new drug screening panels are 25 times more effective at detecting opioids, 23 times more accurate in identifying cocaine use and 13 times more adept at pinpointing amphetamine use.\n\nThe President and CEO of Psychemedics said in a statement that these updates and changes to a very traditionally-based practice are necessary due to shifts in workplace/public perception of risks associated with cannabis use versus the harms and risks associated with fentanyl.\n\n\"Few challenges in the workplace have undergone as dramatic a transformation as the shifting dynamics between marijuana and fentanyl,\" remarked Brian Hullinger, President and CEO at Psychemedics. \"Recognizing this shift, Psychemedics has developed the Advanced 5-Panel to bridge the gap.\"\n\nThe announcement came after a study which Psychemedics said encompassed data from over 1 million drug screenings. Unlike traditional urine-testing which can detect the presence of cannabis anywhere from a few days to around a month, hair testing has traditionally been a source of gripes from cannabis users whose hair follicles can sometimes test positive for cannabis even several months after use.\n\nThese new tests aim to change that standard by providing a more accurate reading than urine testing without the associated stigma of unfairly targeting cannabis users. The FDA has already approved the updated form of testing, according to the press release.\n\n\"For decades, Psychemedics has remained at the forefront of innovation, responding to the ever-evolving needs of our clients,\" the press release said. \"The Advanced 5-Panel Drug Screen epitomizes this legacy, offering clients a cost-effective choice to adapt their testing protocols in sync with evolving priorities and employment policies.\"\n\nThis marks a step forward for cannabis users who wish to consume the plant outside of working hours but Psychemedics is only one of several companies producing drug test kits. A report by Global Market Insights valued the drug testing market size at $6.2 billion in 2022 and estimated the market would jump 16.3% over the next decade to reach $27.1 billion by 2022.\n\nSome states, like California, have opted to pass laws restricting an employer's ability to reprimand their employees for cannabis use but many states, even states that have passed adult-use cannabis laws remain without employee protections for cannabis use.\n\nPsychemedics, according to their website, supplies pre-employment and employee drug screening services to thousands of companies including several companies listed within the Fortune 500. The company credits themselves with pioneering the modern, widely-adapted practice of using hair to screen for drugs.\n\n\"We invented the science that re-invented the drug testing industry,\" Hullinger said in a statement on the Psychemedics website.",

                "body": "The India entity of the banking tech firm Zeta maintained its upward momentum in the fiscal year ending March 2023. Moreover, it turned profitable in the said period as well. The milestone comes despite the company not matching the growth levels of the previous fiscal year (FY22).\n\nZeta India's revenue from operations grew by 32.7% to Rs 816 crore in FY23 from Rs 615 crore in FY22, according to its annual financial statement filed with the Registrar of Companies.\n\nZeta is designed for financial institutions, encompassing credit, DDA, prepaid, loans, savings, processing, authentication, and FRM solutions. It offers services such as credit and debit card processing, and APIs to operate natively within cloud-native apps.\n\nThe sale of software development services is the only source of revenue for the company. With a global presence in 7 countries, the firm generated 76% income from outside India.\n\nSimilar to several SaaS companies, Zeta's employee benefits accounted for the majority of expenses. In FY23, it formed 79% of the overall expenditure. This cost increased by 22.7% to Rs 632 crore in FY23 from Rs 515 crore in FY22. This includes Rs 68.3 crore as ESOP cost which is non-cash in nature.\n\nIts subscription, server, rent, and legal/professional cost took the overall expenditure by 25% to Rs 796 crore in FY23 from Rs 637 crore in FY23.",

                "body": "Oct 30 (Reuters) - Euro area sovereign bond yields edged lower on Monday, with investors reckoning markets broadly priced in a higher-for-longer outlook for policy rates while new data confirmed inflation in Germany was falling.\n\nGermany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was down 3 basis points (bps) at 2.81%. In early October, it hit 3.024%, its highest level in 12 years.\n\nCiti analysts said in a note to clients that their \"Bund yield forecasts adopt a neutral stance near-term with a frontloaded rally in 2024.\"\n\nThey also flagged an \"end-cycle tendency for the market to underprice subsequent (policy rate) cuts.\"\n\nMoney markets are currently pricing zero chance of a rate hike by-year-end and cuts in 2024.\n\nLong-dated yields rose sharply in the last few weeks in a U.S. Treasury-led bond selloff as markets adjusted their positioning to a higher for longer rate outlook and an increase of the so-called term premium - the excess return an investor requires for holding a longer-term bond over short-term investments. Bond prices move inversely with yields.\n\nInflation eased in October in Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia pointing to a substantial cooling in headline inflation in the euro zone's largest economy.\n\nThe German state of Brandenburg released data on Friday.\n\nSpain's 12-month inflation in October was unchanged from the previous month at 3.5%.\n\n\"Favourable base effects in the first half of this year helped to lower headline inflation sharply,\" said Wouter Thierie, economist at ING.\n\n\"Since early summer, we have entered a new phase where favourable base effects play less strongly, allowing headline inflation to pick up again,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's economy shrank slightly in the third quarter, data showed on Monday.\n\nInvestors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve policy meeting due late on Wednesday, while there is a large consensus the cooling inflation is likely to keep the U.S. central bank on pause in coming months. Traders still price in no chance the Fed will lift its policy rate from the current 5.25%-5.5% range.\n\nItaly's 10-year yields, the benchmark for the euro area's periphery, dropped 7.5 bps to 4.73%.\n\nThe gap between Italian and German 10-year yields -- a gauge of the risk premium investors ask to hold debt of the euro zone's most indebted countries -- dropped to 192 bps, its tightest level in around a week.\n\nFurthermore, fears about the conflict in the Middle East supported the appetite for safe-haven sovereign bonds.\n\nStocks were mixed on Monday as Israel's push into Gaza stirred fears of a wider conflict.\n\n(Reporting by Stefano Rebaudo, editing by Angus MacSwan) ;))",

                "body": "GREENWICH, Conn. , Oct. 30, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XPO (NYSE: XPO) today announced its financial results for the third quarter 2023, reflecting a solid performance in a soft industry environment for freight transportation. The company reported diluted earnings from continuing operations per share of $0.72 and adjusted diluted earnings from continuing operations per share of $0.88.\n\nMario Harik, chief executive officer of XPO, said, \"Our third quarter results exceeded expectations, with solid growth in revenue and profitability, and strong forward momentum. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 2%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%, with 50 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion.\n\n\"In North American LTL, we're improving every aspect of the business that impacts customer service and value creation. Our third quarter adjusted operating ratio of 86.2% improved sequentially by 140 basis points, and outpaced seasonality by 370 basis points. This was driven by gains in volume, pricing and labor productivity. Our damage claims ratio was a company-best 0.4% -- a significant improvement from 1.2% two years ago, when we launched our LTL 2.0 plan.\n\n\"We also captured more share in the quarter, as customers responded to our focus on service and investments in capacity. Our yield growth, excluding fuel, accelerated to 6.4%, reflecting the benefit of numerous pricing initiatives underway. We expect to further accelerate yield growth in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nHarik continued \"It's exciting to take large steps forward across the business as we execute our plan. We're making excellent progress, and I'm confident that we're still in the early innings of realizing XPO's full potential.\"\n\nThird Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the third quarter 2023, revenue was $1.98 billion, compared to $1.95 billion for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due primarily to higher tonnage per day and yield, excluding fuel, in the North American LTL segment, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue.\n\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders was $86 million for the third quarter 2023, compared with $92 million for the same period in 2022. Operating income was $154 million for the third quarter, compared with $139 million for the same period in 2022. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per share was $0.72 for the third quarter, compared with $0.79 for the same period in 2022.\n\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $105 million for the third quarter, compared with $110 million for the same period in 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings from continuing operations per share (\"adjusted diluted EPS\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $0.88 for the third quarter, compared with $0.95 for the same period in 2022.\n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $278 million for the third quarter, compared with $262 million for the same period in 2022.\n\nThe company generated $236 million of cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter, and ended the quarter with $355 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, after $133 million of net capital expenditures.\n\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release are provided in the attached financial tables. Seasonality is compared to the same period for the past five years excluding 2020.\n\nThe company will hold a conference call on Monday, October 30, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Participants can call toll-free (from US/Canada) 1-877-269-7756; international callers dial +1-201-689-7817.

(NYSE: XPO) is one of the largest providers of asset-based less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation in North America, with proprietary technology that moves goods efficiently through its network.

Visit xpo.com for more information, and connect with XPO on Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nAs required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), we provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release to the most directly comparable measure under GAAP, which are set forth in the financial tables attached to this press release.\n\nXPO's non-GAAP financial measures in this press release include: adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\") on a consolidated basis and for corporate; adjusted EBITDA margin on a consolidated basis; adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders; adjusted diluted earnings from continuing operations per share (\"adjusted diluted EPS\"); adjusted operating income for our North American Less-Than-Truckload and European Transportation segments; and adjusted operating ratio for our North American Less-Than-Truckload segment.\n\nWe believe that the above adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be reflective of, or are unrelated to, XPO and its business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently, and therefore our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should only be used as supplemental measures of our operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS include adjustments for transaction and integration costs, as well as restructuring costs and other adjustments as set forth in the attached tables. Transaction and integration adjustments are generally incremental costs that result from an actual or planned acquisition, divestiture or spin-off and may include transaction costs, consulting fees, stock-based compensation, retention awards, internal salaries and wages (to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs related to integrating and converging IT systems. Restructuring costs primarily relate to severance costs associated with business optimization initiatives. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating XPO's and each business segment's ongoing performance.\n\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin improve comparability from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest and financing expenses), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax impacts and other adjustments as set out in the attached tables that management has determined are not reflective of core operating activities and thereby assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. We believe that adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS improve the comparability of our operating results from period to period by removing the impact of certain costs and gains that management has determined are not reflective of our core operating activities, including amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, transaction and integration costs, restructuring costs and other adjustments as set out in the attached tables. We believe that adjusted operating income and adjusted operating ratio improve the comparability of our operating results from period to period by removing the impact of certain transaction and integration costs and restructuring costs, as well as amortization expenses as set out in the attached tables.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Photograph: ANI Photo\n\nAs India gears up for polls in five states and the Lok Sabha elections next year, a distinct and electrifying symphony will soon echo through the skies -- the unmistakable thwip-thwip of helicopter rotors.\n\nDemand for charter helicopters for election rallies has taken off, reaching unprecedented heights in recent weeks.\n\nHelicopter rental rates, too, have skyrocketed, with industry insiders reporting an increase of 25 to 50 per cent.\n\nThe surge is also attributed to their limited availability within the country.\n\nOver the next six to eight months, the demand is expected to intensify further as the colossal Lok Sabha elections draw near.\n\nAccording to data shared by the Rotary Wing Society of India (RWSI), a not-for-profit working for the helicopter industry, India currently has about 254 charter helicopters.\n\nHowever, a staggering 190 of them are committed to public sector endeavours, defence operations, corporate ventures, and offshore missions, leaving just 60 to 70 helicopters available to cater to the high-stakes election market.\n\nIn the political arena, a fierce competition plays out as the two major national parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, vie for the lion's share of helicopters to power their election campaigns.\n\nThe demand is higher from the BJP, given its ambitious campaign strategy, says Jees George, director, Golden Eagle Aviation, a Bengaluru-based private aviation firm.\n\n\"Regional parties, in contrast, typically secure one or two helicopters for their top leadership,\" he adds.\n\nThe cast of key players in India's helicopter industry includes heavyweights such as Pawan Hans, Global Vectra, Heligo Charters, Heritage Aviation and Himalayan Heli Services.\n\nThe demand has surged across poll-bound states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana.\n\nHowever, the story in Mizoram, which will vote on November 7, remains one of few bookings and minimal excitement, industry insiders say.\n\nBineesh Paul, mission controller of India at Chennai-based Charter Flights Aviation, reveals the behind-the-scenes picture.\n\n\"Enquiries have surged by over 50 per cent for us, with a significant chunk -- 17-19 per cent -- translating into bookings,\" he says.\n\n\"As the demand continues to rise and advanced bookings accumulate, the natural consequence is higher prices.\"\n\nFor instance, the hourly charges for an aircraft stationed in Chennai may hover around Rs 4.5 lakh, but when we have to ferry it from Hyderabad, the bill could leap to between Rs 6 lakh and Rs 6.75 lakh, he explains.\n\nRWSI President A S Butola attributes India's helicopter scarcity to regulatory complexities and infrastructural bottlenecks.\n\nWord from the ground is that every last of the helicopters is booked, a scenario anticipated to persist for the next six to eight months, he says.\n\nTo put things in perspective, the United States has some 10,000 charter helicopters. Even cities like Sao Paulo in Brazil outnumber India in helicopter count.\n\nButola underscores the need for uniform regulations for both airline operators and helicopters, noting that India's helicopter count peaked at 294, dwindled to 239, and has only recently inched up to 254.\n\nCharter Flights Aviation offers a glimpse into the price dynamics of the helicopter market.\n\nPrices commence at $18 per minute for single-engine helicopters and jump to $35 per minute for their twin-engine counterparts.\n\nMeanwhile, charter flights such as jets start at $17 per minute.\n\n\"Twin engines have higher demand during election season, according to circulars from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation,\" George says.\n\n\"With some helicopters on Chardham duty, the availability is even less.\"\n\nIn the months to come, the skies above promise to be a captivating theatre of action, where helicopters play starring roles, ferrying leaders, and echoing the pulse of democracy.\n\nAerial frenzy Rentals for single-engine charter helicopters: Start at $18 per minute For twin-engine helicopters: Start at $35 per minute For charter flights such as jets: Start at $17 per minute\n\nFeature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/Rediff.com",

The NASDAQ has been correcting but has been strong in relative terms compared to other markets.

The seasonality is very favorable. Price has risen in November 75% of the time for an average gain of 10.6%. From October 27 to December 27, the shares have appreciated almost 80% of the time for an average gain of about 22% over the last 24 years. The monthly cycle is already rising, and the weekly cycle is at a low now. The stock is likely to test the former $500 high, breaking through that level by yearend.\n\nAmazon is ranked third in the screen. In terms of expected return, November has been the second strongest month of the year. The monthly graph is revealing. Note that this is one of the few tech giants that is not very overbought.

This collaboration is poised to significantly boost Ripple's cross-border payment capabilities and expand its crypto liquidity solutions.\n\nHaving processed transactions worth an astounding $30 billion and operating in over 55 countries, Ripple has solidified its position as a critical player in the cryptocurrency space.

These conversations, conducted primarily through social media between 2021 and 2022, were speculative in nature but have fueled community speculation and excitement about XRP's future prospects.\n\nThe dialogue initiated by Uphold posed questions to the XRP community about their expectations and aspirations for XRP's future price. Some community members responded with optimistic predictions of XRP exceeding $1,000 in value. Uphold's engagement in these discussions was seen as a way to connect with the XRP community and foster a sense of anticipation around the digital asset.\n\nCommunity members, influencers, and enthusiasts have since speculated on the nature of these discussions, questioning whether they were hinting at a future partnership or significant developments related to XRP. Screenshots of Uphold's tweets discussing XRP's potential to reach $1,000 have circulated within the community, adding fuel to the speculative fire.\n\nIn light of these developments, the market is closely watching XRP's price movements, especially in relation to the ongoing Ripple Labs case and its potential outcomes. The case has brought about a sense of uncertainty, with the value of XRP hanging in the balance.\n\nFurthermore, Uphold has recently announced plans to purchase XRP on the open market for On-Demand Liquidity (now Ripple Payments) transactions, ensuring that customer deposits will not be leveraged in the process. This move is particularly significant given the large amount of XRP held in customer funds on Uphold, totaling $1.25 billion, compared to $168 million worth of Bitcoin. This decision reflects Uphold's commitment to responsible financial practices and the safeguarding of customer assets.\n\nIn conclusion, the strategic partnership between Ripple and Uphold, coupled with Uphold's engagement with the XRP community and their commitment to ethical financial practices, paints a promising picture for the future of XRP and its ecosystem.",

                "body": "CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 30, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prairie Provident Resources Inc. (\"Prairie Provident\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement with a private oil and gas company to sell the Company's Evi cash-generating unit located in northern Alberta for a base purchase price of $27.0 million payable in cash, subject to effective date adjustments based on an effective date of August 1, 2023 (the \"Evi Sale\"). Upon completion of the Evi Sale, the purchaser will become responsible for all future abandonment and reclamation obligations (ARO) pertaining to the Evi assets, with AER deemed liabilities of approximately $48.1 million gross ($43.5 million net).\n\nIn a separate transaction, the Company has entered into a definitive agreement with another private oil and gas company to sell certain non-core assets located in the Provost area of central Alberta for a base purchase price of $1.8 million payable in cash, subject to effective date adjustments based on an effective date of July 1, 2023, and potential future payments of up to $720,000 in aggregate based on the price of oil and production from the Provost assets during the 24-month period following closing (the \"Provost Sale\").\n\nBoth transactions are currently expected to close on or before January 31, 2024 and are subject to regulatory approval, customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments.\n\nCompletion of the Evi Sale and the Provost Sale will build upon the recapitalization initiated in May 2023 by streamlining the Company's asset portfolio through the disposition of undercapitalized legacy assets, in turn allowing Prairie Provident to focus on higher return development opportunities in Central and Southern Alberta.\n\nProceeds of the completed transactions will allow the Company to achieve a material reduction in debt and associated interest expense. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds will be directed to a development program designed to increase production, cash flow and reserves value from Prairie Provident's core areas located in Central and Southern Alberta, including Princess, Provost and Michichi.\n\nEvi Sale\n\nThe properties included in the Evi Sale comprise the Company's entire asset base in the Northern Alberta region.\n\nThe Company is selling the Evi assets for a base purchase price of $27.0 million payable in cash, subject to effective date adjustments based on an effective date of August 1, 2023. In addition, the purchaser will upon completion become responsible for all future ARO pertaining to the Evi assets, which carry AER deemed liabilities of approximately $48.1 million gross ($43.5 million net).\n\nThe purchase price (before adjustments) represents a prior twelve month operating net income multiple of 3.5x.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the production attributed to the Evi properties averaged 874 boe/d in sales volumes.\n\nProvost Sale\n\nThe properties included in the Provost Sale comprise a portion of the Company's asset base in the region.\n\nThe Company is selling the Provost assets for a base purchase price of $1.8 million payable in cash, subject to effective date adjustments based on an effective date of July 1, 2023. In addition, the Purchaser will upon completion become responsible for future ARO pertaining to the Provost assets, which carry AER deemed liabilities of approximately $2.6 million. The Provost Sale also provides for future contingent payments to the Company of up to $720,000 in aggregate based on the price of oil and production from the Provost assets during the 24-month period following closing as follows: (i) $10,000 for any month that WTI Cushing averages between USD $80.00 and $89.99; (ii) $20,000 for any month that WTI Cushing averages between USD $90.00 and $99.99; and (iii) $30,000 for any month that WTI Cushing averages USD $100 or more, prorated for any month in which production from the assets is less than 70 boe/d.\n\nProduction currently attributed to the Provost properties is approximately 70 boe/d.\n\nAdvisor\n\nNational Bank Financial Inc. acted as financial advisor to Prairie Provident with respect to the Evi Sale.\n\nAbout Prairie Provident\n\nPrairie Provident is a Calgary-based company engaged in the exploration, development and production of low decline, long life oil reserves in Alberta. The Company maintains a significant portfolio of low-risk production enhancement and drilling opportunities.\n\nThe oil and gas industry commonly expresses production volumes and reserves on a \"barrel of oil equivalent\" basis (\"boe\") whereby natural gas volumes are converted at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil. The intention is to sum oil and natural gas measurement units into one basis for improved analysis of results and comparisons with other industry participants. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip. It does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead nor at the plant gate, which is where Prairie Provident sells its production volumes. Boes may therefore be a misleading measure, particularly if used in isolation. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency ratio of 6:1, utilizing a 6:1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release contains certain statements (\"forward-looking statements\") that constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.

                "body": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Another Monday bounce in world markets sets up a Fed-dominated week ahead - although the U.S. central bank may not yet have a great deal to offer stock and bond markets that seem keener to see the glass half empty as October comes to a close.\n\nA worrying late-year stock market unwind is starkest in small-cap indexes now tracking year-to-date losses of some 7% - even as the benchmark S&P500 remains up 7% and Big Tech leaders of the Nasdaq 100 are still 30% higher.\n\nTech stocks gained on Friday, for example, even as the Russell 2000 lost more than 1% on the day to hit its lowest since 2020.\n\nEven though incoming third-quarter earnings seem like a mixed bag - mainly because of some large individual stock losses due to investors' high bar for 2024 outlooks - the aggregate actually looks quite impressive.\n\nAnnual earnings growth for S&P500 companies is now expected to have picked up to a 4.3% annual growth rate, according to LSEG estimates, from as low as 1.6% before the reporting season began. And 77% of companies have beaten Wall Street forecasts.\n\nA big problem for small firms, however, is that they disproportionately bear the burden of the higher borrowing costs that show little sign of coming down any time soon.\n\nThe Federal Reserve delivers its latest policy decision on Wednesday and is widely expected to keep rates unchanged for the second straight meeting. Although futures see less than a 50% chance of another rate rise in the cycle, they don't seen a cut coming until June at the earliest.\n\nAnd even though third-quarter U.S. economic growth raced ahead an annualised 4.9%, many now see that too as a high watermark - with GDP models seeing fourth-quarter growth at less than half that rate for now.\n\nA key input to that as always will be the state of the labor market, with data this Friday expected to show October payroll growth cooling to 188,000 new jobs from the blowout 336,000 gain last month. And autoworker strikes against Detroit's Big Three car manufacturers could subtract at least 29,000 jobs from October, government data shows.\n\nBut beyond Fed policy rates, it's the restive bond market and near 16-year-high long-term borrowing costs that are starting to hurt most. As much concern as there is with the slew of new government debt coming down the pike, a key moment this week may well be the Treasury's quarterly refunding plans today and Wednesday.\n\nFor now at least, market concern about the tense Middle East conflict has allowed some relief. Even though Israel's land invasion of Gaza appears to be under way amid heavy fighting and a dire humanitarian crisis, demands for some aid-related ceasefire are growing.\n\nGlobal bourses and Wall St futures were higher to start the week, with oil and gold prices ebbing a bit - the former now back down 4% year-on-year.\n\nApple dominates the week's earnings diary on Thursday. HSBC gained 1.2% in London after reporting a fresh $3 billion share buyback and a more than doubling of third-quarter profit.\n\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields held steady at 4.85% - well below the 5% threshold they breached last week.\n\nThe dollar was a touch higher, with the Swiss franc ebbing as the Swiss National Bank cut the rate on overnight deposits it pays on commercial bank reserves.\n\nThe yen was firmer as Japanese government bond yields climbed to fresh 10-year peaks near 0.9% on Monday, with markets weighing the chances of another policy tweak in Tuesday's latest monetary policy decision from the Bank of Japan.\n\nIn Europe, data showed Germany's economy contracted by a smaller-than-forecast 0.1% in the third quarter but October inflation numbers showed a sharp easing of price pressures.\n\nIn Hong Kong, a court gave China Evergrande a five-week reprieve to come up with a deal with creditors or face liquidation after the embattled developer said on Monday it was working on a revised debt-restructuring plan. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday: * Dallas Fed manufacturing survey * U.S. corporate earnings: McDonald's, Loews, Western Digital, FMC, Arista Networks, Welltower, VF, Revvity, Simon Property, Healthpeak, Arch Capital, ON Semiconductor * U.S. Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Nick Macfie mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

                "body": "There are signs that China's economic stumbles are starting to stabilize. But looking at quarterly numbers and commentary from multinational companies doing business there, the road back for the world's second-largest economy remains uneven. This paints a fuzzy picture for our stocks that generate lots of revenue in China -- Estee Lauder (EL), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) -- as they get ready to report their quarterly results. While the end of pandemic restrictions in China this year released pent-up demand for in-person services, travel, and entertainment, there has been a cap on momentum due, in part, to high youth unemployment and a troubled real estate market. That's why China is once again looking to pull fiscal and monetary policy levers to reach the government's 2024 economic growth of 5%. Encouraging signs can be found in recent data from the Chinese government and casino operator Las Vegas Sands . Retail sales in China for September, the final month of the third quarter, handily beat estimates with a 5.5% increase. August and July sales were 4.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Las Vegas Sands beat on revenue and matched estimates on earnings. Stronger numbers in Macao indicate some buoyancy in the Chinese consumer and tourism in Asia. However, there are cautionary signals from a couple of other companies and the latest read on Chinese gross domestic product. Following fiscal third-quarter earnings, L'Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said he \"was not super impressed\" by the slow Chinese market, noting experienced weakness in Asia travel retail sales. Club name Procter & Gamble (PG) flagged weakness in China when it reported its fiscal first quarter 2024 earnings. \"Underlying market growth [in China] is soft and choppy as consumer confidence remains weak,\" Andre Schulten, chief financial officer of P & G, said during the company's post-earnings webcast. China reported better-than-expected economic growth of 4.9% in the third quarter. But that's lower than the 6.3% in the second quarter and about equal to the first quarter -- kind of a one-step forward one-step back situation. Let's read the tea leaves in these crosscurrents out of China to see how Estee Lauder, Starbucks and Wynn Resorts might fare when they deliver their earnings next month. EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD The remarks from L'Oreal's CEO amplify what Wall Street is expecting when Estee Lauder reports fiscal 2024 first-quarter earnings before the bell on Nov. 1. Analysts see softer sales for the quarter due to continued softer activity in Asia travel and weaker luxury consumption. Deutsche Bank sees Estee Lauder's top line falling 12% and a wider loss than the Street consensus. The analysts also believe investors are anticipating a softer outlook for the current quarter and for fiscal year 2024 due to concerns stemming from the company's Asia business, which is EL's growth engine. Deutsche Bank has a buy rating on Estee Lauder but lowered its price target to $173 per share from $192, citing lower estimates. Estee Lauder needs more time for inventories in its Asia travel retail business to normalize and demand to pick up in order for its financials to turn around. As travel in China normalizes, EL's revenue and earnings will get a meaningful boost, but it's taking much longer than we anticipated. We're specifically focused on a travel recovery in the Hainan province -- a popular destination for Chinese tourists that's expected to see an influx in duty-free sales. This recovery will take at least another quarter or two so we have to be patient. We expect slow growth throughout the rest of 2023 and improvement in 2024. When we see improvement, the stock should go higher so it makes sense to keep holding it. SBUX YTD mountain Starbucks YTD Given P & G's remarks, we hope Starbucks is still able to keep its China numbers moving in the right direction. The coffee giant is set to release its fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter results before the opening bell on Nov. 2. Following the positive numbers company out of China last quarter , we hope to see continued momentum. Starbucks' growth in China, its second-largest market after the U.S., is still in its early stages. As of last quarter, Starbucks had a total of 6,480 stores in China, getting increasingly closer to its goal of reaching 9,000 stores there by 2025. Starbucks has more than 37,000 worldwide. There are over 16,000 in the U.S. More recently, there's been concern that local competitors are getting promotional to take share. In a recent note, Wells Fargo estimates fiscal Q4 earnings-per-share for Starbucks to come in 22% higher than last year at 99 cents (a couple of cents above the Wall Street consensus) and revenue growth of 9.6% to $9.22 billion. The analysts see a 2.5% increase in China same-store sales in fiscal Q4 -- more in line with fiscal Q2's advance and way slower than fiscal third quarter's 46% advance . On the same day as its upcoming earnings release, Starbucks will host an update on its Reinvention plan, which was implemented last year to enhance the customer experience and improve margins. During this event, we'll be looking to see how the plan will drive business growth throughout 2024. WYNN YTD mountain Wynn Resorts YTD Commentary from Las Vegas Sands gives us hope that Wynn Resorts might be able to continue last quarter's momentum in gross gaming revenue in Macao. Wynn is set to report its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 8. Analysts expect revenue to increase 77% from the year-ago period to $1.58 billion and earnings-per-share are expected to come in at 75 cents versus last year's loss of $1.27. HSBC said in a Monday research note that Wynn has several growth drivers including its expansion in Macao and its newer property investment in Dubai. Outside of gaming, the analysts believe that non-gaming revenue, which includes things like entertainment shows, conventions, and exhibitions, could add to further revenue upside. The note said, \"Wynn Macau is well positioned to leverage non-gaming expansion to gain market share.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long EL, SBUX, WYNN, PG.

                "title": "Homeowners in Chicago north suburbs see huge property tax increase",
                "body": "After months of delay, nearly 1.8 million property tax bills for Cook County home and business owners are landing in mailboxes this week, and many homeowners in the north and northwest suburbs are in for jarring news.\n\nA new analysis from county Treasurer Maria Pappas' research team found the median residential tax bill there increased by 15.7%, according to the report, \"the largest percentage increase in the last 30 years.\"\n\nResidential properties in that part of the county are shouldering a greater share of the tax burden thanks to what one analyst termed a \"perfect storm.\"\n\nAcross all of Cook County's 1.8 million parcels, taxes for 1.3 million homeowners and 94,000 commercial property owners went up, according to the report.\n\nIn the south suburbs, the median residential bill increased by 3.9% and the median commercial bill -- for properties like offices, stores, warehouses and large apartment buildings -- went up by 2%. In Chicago, the median homeowner's bill went up 3%, while the commercial median bill rose only slightly more, 3.1%.\n\nIn all, property taxes across Cook County rose more than $909 million, to $17.6 billion, according to the analysis. That's 5.4% higher than last year, but below the 8% rate of inflation for 2022.\n\nTaxpayers typically see the biggest changes following reassessments, which happen every three years for different parts of the county.\n\nBills landing this week are the first to reflect new valuations from county Assessor Fritz Kaegi and appeals to the county's Board of Review for properties outside the city of Chicago and north of North Avenue. Those second installment tax bills are due by Dec. 1 for all Cook County taxpayers.\n\nHow much each taxpayer owes depends on how much their local schools, park districts and governments raised property tax levies; whether the assessed value of their property rose or fell in relation to other homes and businesses after appeals; and whether their property was affected by special tax increment financing districts.\n\n[ From 2022: 4 things driving Chicago property tax bills higher: Look up your neighborhood ]\n\nSeveral factors collided in the north suburbs, leading to the higher bills, according to Hal Dardick, a former Tribune reporter now at the treasurer's office. He led the analysis along with Todd Lighty, another former Tribune reporter now working for Pappas.\n\nCOVID-19 adjustments Kaegi's office made in 2020 reduced values by about 10%. That adjustment no longer applied to this round of assessments. At the same time, a pandemic-induced hot streak in the housing market boosted sale prices and values. That combination resulted in the assessed values of homes rising by nearly 27.8%, or $3.3 billion, according to the analysis. Commercial values rose by about $767.8 million, or 11.4%.\n\nAppeals also added to homeowners' share of the property tax burden. Property taxes are a zero-sum game: If commercial owners see their total share of all assessed value drop, then homeowners end up shouldering more -- and vice versa.\n\nThe county's Board of Review, which hears appeals to Kaegi's numbers, \"shaved nearly 20% off the total assessed value of commercial and industrial properties set by the Assessor's Office\" in the north suburbs, but granted reductions for \"less than 2% the total value of residential properties.\"\n\nThat shifted more of the burden onto homeowners. When it came time to calculate bills, \"had the Assessor's values not been overturned, about 1% of the tax burden would have shifted from homeowners to commercial properties,\" according to the treasurer's analysis. Instead, \"about 3% of the burden shifted from commercial properties to homes.\"\n\nOverall, total taxes fell for commercial properties in the northern suburbs by $56 million, or 2.75%, compared with 2021.\n\nTaken together, north suburban taxing bodies also raised their levies by about 6.6% compared with 2021, according to the analysis. (Chicago went up by about 5.4% and the south suburbs increased by about 4.4%.)\n\n\"When you combine the reversal of the residential COVID adjustments with the shift of burden from commercial to residential and also take into account the significant levy increases throughout the region, you end up with a perfect storm for residential properties that causes really a once-in-a-generation increase in the burden,\" Dardick said.\n\n[ From 2022: Some Chicago homeowners' property tax increases are due to Board of Review actions, Fritz Kaegi study asserts; board points finger back at assessor ]\n\nWayne Sherman, a 76-year-old retired office equipment salesman and IT analyst, has lived in his 1.5 story, three-bedroom frame home on a corner lot in Park Ridge with his wife for nearly half a century. When he received his assessment notice from Kaegi's office, he was shocked to see his home value jump 65%. It went from $281,000 the previous year to $500,000.\n\nHe went to his local township assessor for help on his appeal, which knocked his home's value down to about $475,000, according to county records. A follow-up call he placed to the township assessor for other options went unreturned, he said. When he tried again, they did not offer another recourse.\n\nA property tax attorney might have encouraged him to take his case to the Board of Review for an appeal, but Sherman told the Tribune \"they're just looking for money too.\"\n\nWhen he looked up his bill earlier this month, it had jumped: His total for the 2022 tax year is $10,744. The year before, it was $6,532.\n\nThat 64% increase was higher than most of his neighbors: The median bill for homeowners in Park Ridge jumped 17% compared with 2022 and stands at $9,773, according to the treasurer's analysis.\n\nIn tandem with his rising assessment, there's another reason his bill jumped so dramatically. Sherman received two key tax breaks on this bill: the homeowner exemption (for those that use that house as their primary residence) and the senior exemption (for those over 65). But another break that Sherman previously received -- the senior freeze -- disappeared last year.\n\nBetween rising Social Security benefits, retirement savings, \"some dividends and investments and taxable accounts,\" Sherman said his earnings were a couple of thousand dollars above the $65,000 threshold to qualify for the tax break that freezes equalized assessed values.\n\nThat limit is set by lawmakers in Springfield and hasn't changed since 2017.\n\nHad Sherman received that senior freeze, the assessor's office said his bill would have been $5,914. If his income falls and he qualifies next year, the base value would return to the $281,000 assessed value from 2021.\n\nLevies set by local property taxing bodies also increased, according to the treasurer's analysis. While the city of Park Ridge and its library district kept their levy about the same, all of the local school districts there, as well as the park district, raised theirs. So did the Cook County Forest Preserves and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District.\n\n[ Toni Preckwinkle declares victory in Cook County Board president race, while Forest Preserve celebrates yes vote on tax hike ]\n\nSherman says he's confused and frustrated about why his assessment jumped so much, especially after seeing neighbors with similar homes sell for far less.\n\n\"Give me the $500,000, I'm out of here tomorrow, but I've had no offers. Obviously I'm not going to sell. I'm probably going to end up here until we both or one of us dies,\" he told the Tribune. \"I don't have an unlimited amount.\"\n\nAmong the suburban communities with the largest percentage increases in median bills for homeowners are Schiller Park, where the median tax grew by 29.7% to $6,387, and Des Plaines, where it grew by 28.7% to $6,067.\n\nSuburban Melrose Park and Northlake faced even bigger hikes, in part because both are split by North Avenue and are assessed separately.\n\nHomes north of North were reassessed at higher levels, while the homes south of the dividing line won't have new values until next year. That ends up pushing more of the overall tax burden onto northern neighbors. Part of the increase north of the dividing line is the result of an increase of more than 10% in taxes sought by taxing districts in that city.\n\nIn Park Ridge, Sherman was blunt in his evaluation of his latest bill: \"I don't mind spending some money when you have to, but this is just greed and stealing without a gun and a ski mask.\"",

Lower profitability is due to the additional cost of PKR 2.5 billion (up to June 30, 2023) on account of\n\nGovernment's GST policy, which was discriminatory to domestic DAP producer (resolved since July 2023), and the exchange loss of PKR 3.6 billion on foreign payments due in 2022, which could not be paid till Q1, 2023 due to State Bank restrictions.\n\nOn a Consolidated basis, during the nine-month period, the Company reported gross profit of PKR 26 billion (SPLY: PKR 24 billion) and operating profit of PKR 18 billion (SPLY: PKR 17 billion). However, the profit after tax\n\ndeclined to PKR 163 million from PKR 3.6 billion reported in SPLY. This decrease is primarily attributed to the\n\nreduced earnings of FFBL. On the brighter side, there is a significant improvement in the financial results of Fauji\n\nFFL is pursuing the strategy of margin assertive growth with focus on internal efficiencies with consistency. During the nine-months period, FFL has achieved a significant 83% increase in sales revenue (PKR 15 billion as against PKR 8 billion in SPLY) and 3.5 times growth in gross margins, 12.3% as compared to 3.5% in SPLY. FFL has achieved its highest ever quarterly profit after tax of PKR 38.5 million (SPLY loss after tax of PKR 690 million). Looking ahead, FFL's investment in brands and distribution infrastructure is expected to continue fueling growth and translate into improved financial performance.\n\nFFBL Power Company Limited has also delivered consistent performance. Due to shrinking of margins owing to\n\nincrease in raw material prices the financial performance of our Joint venture, Pakistan Maroc Phosphore S.A. in\n\nMorocco, has suffered a bit of a decline.\n\nFauji Meat Limited (FML) has achieved revenue of PKR 490 Million (SPLY: 53 Million) representing significant\n\ngrowth on the backdrop of export sales and positive EBITDA for the period.\n\nTo focus more on its core business the Company during the 3rd quarter concluded the sale of its entire shareholding (95.07%) in FML to Fauji Foundation as part of its strategic divestment plan. This transaction resulted in a gain of\n\nPKR 268 million with a corresponding increase in the cash inflow of PKR 4.3 billion. This will help save significant finance cost in times to come.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nDear Stakeholders, while the Country is passing through serious economic challenges, our utmost concern regarding the sustainable performance of FFBL is to secure consistent gas supplies for our production plants. In this respect, we have proactively engaged with the relevant decision makers and are advocating for the significance of local DAP and Urea production for our farming community, economy, and our overall national food security.\n\nWe continue to advocate that the Government should recognize the significance of sole producer of DAP, which is necessary for better yield, and Urea, provide an environment conducive to the sustainable development of the sector and take all stakeholders on board while making key policy decisions to better understand the implications and long-term consequences. There is a dire need for the Government to take immediate steps to prioritize the fertilizer sector with respect to providing a consistent supply of Gas thus avoiding the shortage of DAP and Urea in the country and saving the scarce forex spend on import.",

                "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures climbed on Monday as tensions in the Middle East failed to dampen investor sentiment ahead of a busy week full of earnings reports and an interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve.\n\nIsraeli troops stepped up ground operations in Gaza early on Monday, with Palestinians in the enclave reporting fierce air and artillery strikes as the conflict entered its fourth week.\n\nHowever, the clashes had little impact on U.S. stock markets, with megacap growth names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) up between 0.9% and 1.6% in premarket trading.\n\n\"The ground offensive in Gaza will still be causing some concern, but it has been largely expected and that's why I don't think you've seen any kind of particularly adverse reaction on the markets today,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\"In the United States, the emphasis has returned to the resilience within the U.S. economy and that being a good thing rather than as an indicator that there could be a rate hike.\"\n\nGeopolitical concerns as well as a surge in Treasury yields have weighed on U.S. equities this month, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down over 10% from its intraday high in July.\n\nOn Monday, the yield on the ten-year note was at 4.86%, after having breached the 5% level earlier this month.\n\nAdding to bond market worries, the U.S. Treasury is likely to boost the size of auctions for bills, notes, and bonds in the fourth quarter when it announces its financing plans this week to fund a worsening budget deficit. A subsequent rise in yields may further pressure stocks.\n\nWith inflation gradually easing in the United States, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of its policy meeting on Nov. 1, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fedwatch tool.\n\nHowever, certain parts of the economy have proved to be resilient, spurring concerns that the central bank could signal willingness to hold rates at their current level for longer than previously anticipated.\n\nA fresh batch of data on the U.S. economy this week, ending with the October's non-farm payrolls report on Friday, will be on the watchlist for further cues on the Fed's monetary policy path.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Coherus Biosciences (NASDAQ:CHRS) jumped 15.2% in premarket trade as the U.S. health regulator approved the company's treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer.",

Both pipelines are defunct.\n\nIts Russian business had provided much of its income for decades and prior to the 2022 events contributed half its output.\n\nWintershall is targeting annual cost savings of 200 million euros and is laying off 500 staff, it announced in September after being cut off from its Russian earnings in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We are adapting Wintershall Dea to strengthen competitiveness, reduce administrative costs and further consolidate the focus on our strategic direction,\" Chief Financial Officer Paul Smith said in a statement on Monday.\n\nOverall daily production in the third quarter was 324,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE), down 1%, with the Norwegian Aasta Hansteen and Skarv fields in Norway impacted by unplanned maintenance.\n\nEBITDAX (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exploration), an oil industry measure, was down 53% at 964 million euros.\n\nBut with non-Russian activities in Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa continuing, the company raised capital expenditure 11% to 243 million euros, due to higher development activity, particularly in Argentina.\n\nWintershall Dea will hold press calls later on Monday.",

                "body": "Long before Britpop, there was Beatlemania. Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr spent the 1960s paving the way for music as we know it today, pioneering pop, innovating recording techniques and providing the basis for future subcultures to thrive. The enduring influence of The Beatles spans genres and generations, including Blur co-founder Graham Coxon.\n\nActing as guitarist for the Britpop pioneers since the band's inception in 1988, Coxon has contributed to some of the most beloved and seminal works in the genre. From the iconic 'Parklife' to the recent release of The Ballad of Darren, Coxon has been a staple throughout the band's existence.\n\nParticularly early on, the band were heavily influenced by their British guitar band predecessors, including the Kinks and the Beatles. The latter were particularly instrumental in Coxon's youth, he once recalled the experience of hearing 'Revolution' for the first time as life-changing in an interview with NME.\n\n\"I first heard 'Revolution' when I was four years old, I guess I was just lucky enough to be able to work the record player and recognise it from the apple in the middle,\" he recalled, \"I liked to play with the knobs on the front of the record player, turn the bass right up... I probably even only got the right-hand speaker. I just wanted it to be as big as possible. I've still got that record. I keep it in a box with loads of 45s I bought as teenager. As a kid it gave me that feeling.\"\n\nThough the iconic 'Revolution' may have been the first song to prompt Coxon's personal Beatlemania, his most-played record since then is the Beatles' seventh studio record, Revolver. In fact, while speaking with NME, Coxon named the album as not only his most frequented Beatles album, but the record he has played the most full stop.\n\nReleased in 1966, the record represented the Beatles at their most experimental. Featuring the sprawling 'Tomorrow Never Knows' and the iconic 'Yellow Submarine', the record is hugely acclaimed. Though the record has been praised by critics and favoured by Coxon, one of Blur's other early influences was unimpressed with the record.\n\nRay Davies, equally revered by Blur and even considered to be the godfather of Britpop, once gave Revolver a scathing review. The Kinks frontman called the record \"very commercial,\" and was particularly critical of 'Eleanor Rigby', which he suggested \"sounds like they're out to please music teachers in primary schools.\"\n\nWhether it pleased primary school music teachers or not, it certainly pleased Coxon enough to take the title for his most replayed record of all time.

At the same time, it is also a clear signal to all bidders in the current tender for the construction of new nuclear power plants that the permitting process is being implemented,\" says Daniel Beneš, Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of ČEZ.\n\nThe application for a zoning permit for the new nuclear plants at the Dukovany site was submitted by Elektrárna Dukovany II to the Construction Department of the Municipal Office in Třebíč. In view of the necessity to address the objections of the parties to the proceedings due to systemic bias of officials, updates to the Czech Land Use Policy and changes to the legislation in force during the proceedings, as well as the scope of the documentation, the Department requested six deadline extensions for the decision. Following a change in the Building Act, the administrative proceedings were transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade in July this year.",

                "title": "Vietnam a potential investment market for retailers | Business | Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus)",
                "body": "Hanoi (VNS/VNA) - Vietnam, with a population of nearly 100 million people, is considered a potential investment market for famous retailers around the world, therefore, many foreign retailers have increased their investments.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Vietnam's retail market has a scale of more than 142 billion USD, 16% of which comes from e-commerce. This scale is forecast to increase to 350 billion USD, or nearly 2.5 times higher, by 2025.\n\nThe retail based on e-commerce platforms is also growing at an exponential rate. E-commerce businesses in Vietnam gained a revenue of 14 billion USD by 2022, and the revenue is expected to reach 32 billion USD by 2025.\n\nThese figures show the huge potential of Vietnam's retail market for enterprises at home and abroad.\n\nA supermarket is still considered an attractive retail option in Vietnam, with diverse products, a seamless customer experience, and guaranteed product quality.\n\nData from Euromonitor shows that supermarket revenue in 2023 is estimated to reach about 110 trillion VND (4.5 billion USD), an increase of 8.8% over the previous year.\n\nThese figures confirm a significant change in consumer shopping behaviour.\n\nVietnam has witnessed excitement in the domestic retail market from the first months of the year until now, when a series of big brands in the foreign retail industry has announced an increase in investment capital to this market.\n\nAmong them, MUJI - a famous retail brand for lifestyle, leather goods, and office furniture from Japan, has expanded its retail system in Hà Nội and HCM City to 11 stores.\n\nMeanwhile, Uniqlo - another big brand from Japan, also opened its 19th store in Hanoi, which is the fourth new store in the first half of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, in recent years, many large Thai enterprises have also evaluated Vietnam's retail market as one of the most potential and attractive markets.\n\nTherefore, Central Retail Group, a giant in Thailand's retail industry, has announced a schedule to increase investment capital in Vietnam to 1.45 billion USD (35 trillion VND) in the period of 2023 - 2027, along with the goal of doubling the number of stores and supermarkets in Vietnam to 600 in 57 out of 63 provinces and cities. This is considered the largest investment ever announced by Central Retail.\n\nTo implement those goals, this year, the company has spent about 4.1 trillion VND in the Vietnam market, focusing on developing essential foods businesses, stabilising prices, and restructuring electronic stores.\n\nCentral Retail also aims to become the largest multi-channel retailer in the food industry, and the second largest investor in the shopping centre segment in Vietnam's real estate market by 2027.\n\nMeanwhile, local retailers still dominate the domestic market, accounting for 70 - 80% of total retail sales points nationwide. There are big brands with thousands of sales points such as WinMart, Co.op Mart, and Bach Hoa Xanh.\n\nHowever, foreign retailers' investment in the Vietnam market also puts certain pressure on domestic retailers. This situation urges domestic businesses to find ways to compete with foreign rivals.\n\nIn the past few years, Vietnamese businesses expanded their retail market share strongly in the segment of supermarkets and convenience stores.\n\nOf which, in mid-2018, Saigon Co.op acquired the entire retail system of Auchan (France) in Vietnam. In 2019, Singapore's Shop&Go also sold its business in Vietnam to VinCommerce.\n\nLast year, THISO International Commerce and Services Corporation (THISO), a subsidiary of THACO Group, completed the acquisition of the Republic of Korea (RoK)'s Emart Inc's business in Vietnam.\n\nAlong with implementing the merger and acquisition (M&A) activities with foreign brands in Vietnam, many domestic retailers have also expanded their retail systems in the domestic market.\n\nNotably, Vingroup's Vincom Retail system owns more than 80 shopping centres nationwide. The WinMart and WinMart retail chains, with more than 3,500 convenience stores, are constantly opening new sales points.\n\nAlthough the market is very competitive, economic experts still believe that Vietnamese retail businesses will have a solid foothold in the domestic retail market due to the advantages of understanding Vietnamese consumers, implementing digital transformation, and restructuring human resources.\n\nTo maintain their market shares, expert Vu Vinh Phu said that Vietnam companies need to improve in all aspects, from training professional human resources to building modern infrastructure, meeting the needs of the digital age to continue development in the retail sector.\n\nRetail enterprises must always link to producers of Vietnamese goods, especially agricultural and food products, to ensure stability for the input of the distribution system.\n\nAlso, according to Phu, the domestic retailers are now mostly small and medium-sized enterprises, and there is no large retail group. Therefore, a joint venture with foreign retailers is necessary.\n\nThe newly published report of Rong Viet Securities (VDSC) predicts that the retail industry will slightly recover in the second half of 2023 and improve more clearly in 2024. Market leaders will continue to grow their market share after the slowdown.\n\nRetailers will increasingly target the Northern regions, where modern trade channels have not yet gained substantial traction. However, they will first focus on consolidating their market share in the South before tapping into these untapped markets. Urbanisation will also play a role in shaping consumer behaviour, allowing for the expansion of modern retail networks in Tier 2 and 3 areas, according to the report.\n\nTo restore consumer demand in the last months of the year, localities are ready with promotion programmes. In Hanoi, this year's promotion programmes last longer and focus on each kind of goods according to each month's theme.\n\nTran Thi Lan Phuong, Acting Director of the Hanoi Department of Industry and Trade, said the department has received 21,000 trade promotion programmes from 4,000 businesses registered to participate, double last year's number, and continues to add more.\n\nFor example, in November, the \"Promotion Month\" event is deployed in the city with participants being enterprises, production, and business facilities of all economic sectors.\n\nAlso in November, the event \"Hanoi Midnight Sale 2023\" will attract about 200 businesses, shopping centres, supermarkets, convenience store chains, production, and business facilities.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade also said that from now until the end of the year, the ministry will direct the people's committees of cities and the departments of industry and trade to promote the consumption stimulus programme associated with stabilising the market of goods for the Lunar New Year in 2024, and organising the cultural and tourism events to both attract tourism and increase purchasing power.\n\nBusinesses also said that many policies of the Government, such as reducing value-added tax and increasing the base salary from July 1, are expected to increase consumers' purchasing power, contributing to the recovery of GDP in 2023.\n\nThe experts also believed that the State's efforts to promote consumption and the businesses' diverse business strategies are helping the business of the retail industry be better in the last months of the year./.",

                "title": "from balok to [spoilers], the 'star trek: lower decks' easter eggs and connections in",
                "body": "We have already recapped and reviewed Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4, episode 9, \"The Inner Fight,\" and discussed it on the All Access Star Trek podcast. Like many episodes of Lower Decks, there are many fun nods and Easter eggs, but this episode also had some major connections to franchise lore (and not just the Star Trek franchise), so obviously this analysis has SPOILERS with the biggest ones lower down in the article.\n\nOutpost weirdos and Kirk spacesuit\n\nThe episode kicked off with Boimler and Mariner dealing with some Federation Outpost Scientists like the ones they first tussled with in the season 3 episode \"Reflections.\" When Mariner risked her life to rescue the scientists from the venomous tremble lizards Boimler made it clear it was not for any affection, noting \"She thinks you're weirdos.\"\n\nWhen the tremble lizards got inside the fence at the outpost everyone (except Mariner) put on anti-venom suits, which resembled the 23rd century EV suits seen on Star Trek: The Original Series.\n\nKlingon weirdo and Kirk Fu\n\nLater when Mariner fights with the Klingon Ma'ah she employs a few classic Klingon barbs, including calling him a petaQ, which may be the most commonly used Klingon curse word in Star Trek and according to the Klingon Dictionary means \"weirdo.\" Mariner also deploys one of the fighting moves made famous by James T. Kirk (aka \"Kirk Fu\") with a double-fist punch.\n\nMudd's Puppet\n\nOver on an entirely different planet, Mariner's mom was dealing with an antagonistic alien information broker until she thought she recognized something about him, saying it was an \"ancient trick\" and accusing him of being a puppet. Only when she grabbed the alien it was confirmed she was wrong. But one can understand her confusion as the broker looked just like the Balok puppet from the TOS episode \"The Corbomite Maneuver.\"\n\nThe totally not a puppet alien was found in a bar named Mudds which Freeman describes as a \"notorious dive for all sorts of unsavory rogues.\" That is an apt description for one of the franchise's first rogues, Harcourt Fenton Mudd a smuggler and con-man who first appeared on TOS and later on The Animated Series and Discovery. It's possible this bar was named by him, or possibly in his honor.\n\nTrek Wars\n\nWhile the name was from classic Trek, the whole vibe of Mudds, and New Axton in general, was from an entirely different galaxy, far far away. Comments about how the planet was lawless and a \"favorite of every troublemaker in the quadrant\" all harken back to the first Star Wars movie and the visit to Mos Eisley, home of the most famous Cantina (technically Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina) in all of sci-fi.\n\nThe officious people who ran New Axton and made the Cerritos park next one of the moons wore uniforms like Imperial officers from Star Wars, even speaking in the same snooty British accents.\n\nThere was even what appeared to be an homage to Return of the Jedi on the planet with Mariner and Ma'ah. The Federation monitoring station in the forest looked a lot like the Imperial shield bunker on the forest moon Endor.\n\nBillups the Bounty Hunter\n\nOne of the quintessential elements of Star Wars is cool bounty hunters in helmets like Boba Fett and \"The Inner Fight\" had one of those too. On New Axton a helmeted bounty hunter appeared to be getting the better of Freeman, but in the end it turned out to be a ruse orchestrated by her as the bounty hunter was just Billups all along. He was disguised in the suit and his voice had the same distorted sound of the helmeted Breen from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nLower Decks meets \"Lower Decks\"\n\nThe deepest connections in this episode are not easter eggs, but key points where character and plot arcs tie into some important parts of franchise lore, specifically Star Trek: The Next Generation. Series creator Mike McMahan has often spoken about how an inspiration for the show Lower Decks was the season seven TNG episode \"Lower Decks\" which focused on a group of ensigns on the USS Enterprise-D. One of those ensigns was the Bajoran Sito Jaxa, who was recruited for a covert mission and ended up getting killed. One of the big reveals of \"The Inner Fight\" is that Mariner was close friends with Sito at Starfleet Academy and her death is what set her on a path of rejecting authority, especially accepting any authority by constantly self-sabotaging any promotions. So Mariner's own origin story is now directly linked to the origin story for the series itself.\n\nIt was Nick!\n\nThe dive into TNG goes even deeper to the season 5 TNG episode \"The First Duty,\" which introduced the character of Sito, at that time attending Starfleet Academy along with Wesley Crusher. Both were members of the Academy's elite Nova Squadron and after a fatal accident, both were involved in a coverup trying to hide how a member was killed performing a banned maneuver. The leader of Nova Squadron was Cadet Nick Locarno who also pushed the group to lie to Starfleet and for that, he was expelled. Locarno was played by Robert Duncan McNeill who went on to play Tom Paris in seven seasons of Star Trek: Voyager and Paris was loosely based on Locarno. And \"The Inner Fight\" brought McNeill and Locarno back in a big way, as it turns out Nick built the mystery ship that has been the focus of the big season plot arc. The episode ended with him beaming Mariner off the planet and it was made clear they knew each other from back at the Academy.\n\nLocarno has been capturing ships with the help of lower deckers on each ship. The episode ended on a cliffhanger with Nick telling Mariner: \"we're gonna cause some trouble together.\" Locarno appears to be building up his own fleet and they are using a five-pointed star symbol as their emblem, which can be seen on Nick's jacket above, and painted on the hull of the Klingon Bird of Prey Che'Ta' (which, along with Ma'ah, was first introduced in the season 2 episode \"wej Duj\"). This pattern Locarno is using comes from the Kolvoord Starburst maneuver, which is what got him banned from the Academy.\n\nDancing Boimler\n\nFreeman was seeking out Nick Locarno on New Axton as Starfleet was concerned about ex-Starfleet officers being targeted by the same group behind the alien ship attacks. Locarno was one of four they mentioned along with Seven of Nine from Star Trek: Voyager, Beverly Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation, and William Riker's transporter clone Thomas Riker. Boimler was particularly excited they would be assigned to find Beverly Crusher, however, that job was assigned to the USS Vancouver, a ship introduced in the season one episode \"Cupid's Errant Arrow.\" Later as Boimler slept we could hear him dreaming, saying \" Teach me how to tap-dance, Beverly Crusher.\" Like actress Gates McFadden, Beverly Crusher was an expert in dance and she taught Data to dance (including tap) in the TNG season 4 episode \"Data's Day.\"\n\nKeep up with all the news and reviews from the new Star Trek Universe on TV at TrekMovie.com.",

                "body": "The government is likely to collect R52bn less tax than projected in February. Image: Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg\n\nSouth African Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana is in a bind as he reworks the nation's budget in the face of lower-than-expected tax revenue and pressure from the ruling party to bolster government services ahead of next year's crunch elections.\n\nWhile a commodity boom previously gave Godongwana some breathing space, recent metal price declines and rail constraints have curtailed the mining industry's income and contribution to state coffers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nThe government is likely to collect R52 billion ($2.8 billion) less tax than projected in February, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. They also expect the consolidated budget shortfall to be 5.3% of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, wider than the National Treasury's projection of 4%.\n\nTo balance the books, Godongwana has signaled that he will trim spending and raise borrowing when he delivers his medium-term budget statement in Cape Town on November 1. Any plans to increase taxes will typically be announced in the main budget in February. All those options will encounter fierce opposition from different quarters.\n\n\"The first thing he must say is it's impossible to continue borrowing money,\" said Jannie Rossouw, an economics professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. \"Then he must give us a clear idea of where the reprioritisation would come from, where will he spend more and where will he spend less.\"\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa and the ruling African National Congress have pushed back against austerity measures, an unsurprising response given that opinion polls show the party risks losing its national majority in the upcoming vote for the first time since it took power in 1994.\n\n\"The problem with debt is the capacity of the economy to service it,\" Godongwana said in a speech over the weekend, in which he revealed that the Treasury will be forced to raise additional funding to limit expenditure cuts. \"In this environment, in this trajectory, our ability to service that debt is becoming constrained and therefore we have got to do something about it.\"\n\nNatig Mustafayev, emerging markets portfolio manager at Barings, considers it unlikely that there will be any good news in the budget, with the elections adding to spending pressures\n\nOne key program that Godongwana will struggle to cut is the payment of a R350 temporary monthly welfare grant, which was first introduced to cushion the vulnerable during the coronavirus pandemic. More than 8 million people receive the grant, and there's a risk of social unrest should it be withdrawn. Two thirds of 12 economist surveyed expect the stipend to be extended by a year, and the balance see it being paid indefinitely.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"The upcoming elections and consideration of the potentially harmful effect of spending cuts on a weak economy are likely to keep the government's adjustments to the budget modest.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\n-- Yvonne Mhango, Africa economist\n\nState logistics company Transnet, whose inability to provide adequate services is proving a major constraint on exports and economic growth, is also pressuring the Treasury to assume part of its R130 billion of debt -- as it did for struggling power utility Eskom.\n\nThe \"government is struggling to take a proper hard stance on state-owned entities and they remain one of the biggest risks to our fiscus and credit ratings,\" said Mike van der Westhuizen, a portfolio manager at Citadel Investment Services.\n\nHSBC economist David Faulkner urged Godongwana to clearly spell out the budget trade-offs and policy choices that need to be taken to correct the country's precarious fiscal position.\n\nThere's been a lot of recent emphasis \"around cost containment measures and spending cuts and ways to offset this increasing spending on government wages,\" he said. \"What's done in the near term is going to be important.\"\n\n© 2023 Bloomberg",

His own mother, Spring Thibaudeau, allegedly kidnapped him because she believed that her 16-year-old son was chosen by God. Spring had an obsession with doomsday and the second coming of Christ.\n\nAlong with Blaze, officials also discovered his sister Abigail Snarr, 23, and his uncle, Brook Hale, at the Alcan Port of Entry. Although the investigation is still in progress, the police believe that the teen was taken from his home in Gilbert via Idaho.\n\nBlaze's family failed to contact him and eventually informed cops about his disappearance. Soon, arrest warrants were issued for Spring and her brother, Hale.\n\nWho is Blaze Thibaudeau's alleged kidnapper?\n\nSpring Thibaudeau, Blaze's own mother is his alleged kidnapper. She and her brother Hale were charged and arrested for custodial interference and conspiracy to commit custodial interference in Arizona. However, Abigail was not charged.\n\nThe teenager's father, Ben Thibaudeau, informed the police of his son's disappearance on Wednesday, October 25, 2023. His relationship with his wife, Spring, was estranged. He furthermore informed officials that Spring had purchased a lot of survival equipment and even went off the grid. She believed that Blaze was chosen by the almighty.\n\nBen Thibaudeau spoke to East Idaho News where he said,\n\n\"They feel they needed to take him to an undisclosed location where he would receive his calling and understand his role in the Second Coming. I fear for his safety, especially if my son is contentious, rebellious, or belligerent. I fear that my brother-in-law would restrain him or do something that would incapacitate him.\"\n\nBen Thibaudeau was the temporary sole custodian of his son. On Monday, he received a call from his estranged wife where she explained that she needed to go to the hospital. However, later that day, Ben found Spring packing and talking about the second coming.",

Gold Processing & Refining Corp for the Masbate Gold Project (MGP) power plant located on Masbate Island in the Philippines. Wärtsilä has operated and maintained the power plant since 2009, and the renewal order was booked by Wärtsilä in June 2023.\n\nPhil. Gold operates the processing plant in the MGP operations. Phil. Gold is fully owned by B2Gold Corp. B2Gold is a low-cost international senior gold producer headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, and owns three operating gold mines and numerous development and exploration projects in various countries including Mali, the Philippines, Namibia, Canada, Colombia, Finland and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe Masbate mine is remotely located some 360 km southeast of the country's capital, Manila and has no connection to the grid. The power plant is, therefore, the sole source of electricity, and its operational reliability is essential to maintain the mine's production schedules.\n\n\"The plant's availability, efficiency, and reliability are critical to our operations. Wärtsilä has provided the professional support to ensure that we get the power we need for the past fourteen years, so it was natural that we continue this agreement,\" commented Ryan Rusk, President at PGPRC.\n\n\"Wärtsilä has extensive experience in providing power to mining operations around the world. The locations can be challenging, often with high ambient temperatures and limited water supplies for cooling purposes.

                "title": "GAO Assesses Health Of The Defense Industrial Base - Antitrust, EU Competition  - Worldwide",
                "body": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nThe health of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) has been brought to the fore as the United States responds to wars in Ukraine and Israel. Unfortunately, according to the National Defense Industrial Association's \"Vital Signs\" report, the U.S. DIB faces numerous challenges due to limited capacity to surge production, political obstacles to defense budgeting, and labor challenges.\n\nRecently, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been active in assessing the health of the DIB and recommending policy tweaks to support it.\n\nThis month, the Government Watchdog found that the Department of Defense (DoD) lacks the necessary insight into the defense industry's mergers and acquisitions, impairing its ability to understand how consolidation affects the DIB. Notably, the report found that the DoD does little to monitor the effects of completed mergers & acquisitions (M&A) transactions on the DIB, there is inadequate coordination between antitrust agencies in the DoD when reviewing proposed transactions, and the DoD lacks the same information that antitrust officials have access to when completing their assessment.\n\nTo cure the problems identified, GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense ensures the DoD does the following:\n\nWhile the GAO's recommendations are in no way binding, the report does put a spotlight on a lack of oversight of the risks associated with the consolidation of DoD contractors. This comes as the Biden administration has ramped up antitrust scrutiny -- albeit somewhat unsuccessfully -- of proposed M&A, and a February 2022 DoD report highlighted the national security risks associated with contractor consolidation. With increased antitrust scrutiny of government contractor activities likely, it is incumbent upon contractors to take steps to reduce the likelihood of adverse actions.\n\nTeaming Agreements\n\nIf antitrust officials want to bring enforcement actions against government contractors, teaming agreements could be a key area of concentration. These arrangements allow two or more contractors to enter into agreements allocating workshare under specific contracts. They can offer enormous efficiencies and competitive advantages to a bidder; however, without a well-crafted agreement, they can represent vectors of antitrust risk.\n\nTeaming agreements can pose risks as they generally require contractors to commit to not submit bids independently or with another party. In addition, concerns especially mount when two leading bidders join forces or the agreement locks up a critical technology or capability, presenting vertical foreclosure concerns. To protect against bid rigging or anticompetitive enforcement actions, a contractor should clearly demonstrate the complementary skills bidders will combine for the benefit of the customer. Also, contractors should combine resources and activities to drive efficiencies. This will further evidence that the agreement is not simply an agreement not to compete -- restraining competition -- but a lawful pairing of contractor capabilities to better serve the government's needs. Lastly, while there is no mandatory notification for teaming agreements, in some circumstances where the agreements raise significant concerns, it may make sense to discuss with the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division or Federal Trade Commission before the agreement's implementation.\n\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\n\nIn September 2023, at the Department of Treasury's Second Annual Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) Conference, Assistant Secretary for Investment Security at the Department of Treasury, Paul Rosen, stressed a \"renew[ed] [] focus on compliance and ensuring we have the resources to do so.\" He continued, \"[t]his means parties can expect more compliance checks, questions, and site-visits.\" This renewed emphasis on compliance will include adding resources to detect and bring enforcement actions for non-notified transactions -- those deals that didn't notify CFIUS of the transaction, however, should have -- and enhanced oversight of compliance with mitigation agreements.\n\nGiven the current regulatory environment, M&A activity among DIB contractors will likely garner considerable attention from CFIUS. Contractors should ensure they understand their obligations under CFIUS when considering acquisition opportunities and following closing in the event certain mitigation agreements are agreed to. In addition, companies who have already completed transactions but inappropriately failed to notify CFIUS should prepare for compliance with potential future obligations.\n\nConclusion\n\nDue to ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, an emerging concern over the health of the U.S. DIB, and the current posture of Biden administration antitrust officials, it is likely antitrust scrutiny of government contractor consolidation and M&A activities will increase. Contractors, strategic acquirers, and private equity investors should be aware of this increased scrutiny and be proactive when dealing with inquiries from DoD or DOJ on contractor consolidation or M&A activity.",

                "body": "Like so many IT leaders, Richard Wiedenbeck wears multiple hats. Yet unlike his peers, Wiedenbeck's dual roles -- the top technology executive as well as the transformation lead at Ameritas -- are often at odds.\n\nAs chief technology officer, Wiedenbeck is driving automation and IT modernization to reduce complexity and technical debt. In his chief transformation officer (CTO) capacity, the current mission is to spearhead an enterprise transformation effort that takes aim at operational efficiency. To hit both marks, Wiedenbeck is intentional about separating the roles. He's also made compromises on the digital agenda to advance larger enterprise transformation goals.\n\n\"I really do think about the two roles differently,\" says Wiedenbeck, senior vice president and chief technology and transformation officer (CTTO) for the financial services and insurance company. \"I don't think of it as an extension of the CIO job, but rather as a separate role to ensure we achieve transformation. The good news is I can talk to myself to reset objectives.\"\n\nNot every leader is ready or willing to self-referee complex trade-off discussions. But a growing number of companies are game for formalizing a position devoted to oversight of large-scale transformation efforts and sometimes that role is being filled by the CIO.\n\nWhile transformation of business processes, revenue models, and organizational structure has been ongoing for some time, the past few years have seen accelerated change. The technology front has been particularly active as new digitally enabled services, experiences, and workflows went live to keep revenue flowing and businesses operational during the height and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Close to two-thirds (61%) of respondents to Foundry's 2022 Digital Business research confirmed the global pandemic forced their organization to formulate and execute a digital-first strategy. By 2023, 93% of responding organizations said they have adopted or planned to adopt digital-first business strategies, continuing the transformation wave.\n\n\"It's not that this work hasn't been done before by anyone else, but because the change activity is so rapid now, companies feel the need to create a role that sits at the helm of that change activity,\" says Angela Yochem, a multi-industry CxO, who recently served as chief transformation officer at a major health care provider. \"Anything that is truly transforming the business, not just modernizing, streamlining, or optimizing it, probably requires someone to look after that significant change.\"",

Look no further than the 11 interest rate hikes uncorked by the Federal Reserve since its tightening campaign began in March 2022.\n\nI am shocked the market isn't picking up on this elongating stress (or maybe it is, hence the Nasdaq correction), and how it may shape stock prices in 2024.\n\nOne CFO of a $100 billion-plus market cap tech company tells me higher interest rates are beginning to penetrate all areas of his business. That includes hiring plans, capital allocation, and new deals. I wouldn't say this CFO was panicked on the phone, but there is a new pressure building on his operating model to begin making changes with an eye toward slashing expenses.\n\nThis CFO isn't alone.\n\nHere's what several top leaders have told me on Yahoo Finance Live about the increasingly outreached tentacles of the Federal Reserve. Keep all of this in mind as Fed chief Jerome Powell takes the stage later this week to reiterate his stance that inflation must be stomped out -- even at the expense of Corporate America and economic growth.\n\n\"I'm not an economist. What I will tell you is I think we've hit a level where people are questioning investment, not in infrastructure, not in public-private partnerships, but where people have the opportunity to delay, especially private developers. I think they're working on the math because of the interest rates.\"\n\n\"For probably lack of a better analogy, I would call, right now, the housing market Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. And the reason why I'm saying this is you have two sides. The new housing -- you all have seen, the order intake is solid because there's strong demand for new housing.\n\nThe other side is existing home sales, which is a very, very big part of our overall demand. And existing home sales, as you all seen are now at sub 4 million, you have to go back all the way back to 2010. So you have this odd situation where you have a structural undersupply of a market, which drives positive on new home sales. But right now, there's just not enough existing homes in the inventory to turn around because everybody's afraid of losing attractive mortgage rates, etc.\n\nSo these are two very opposing trends right now. Over time and in the long term, we say that repeatedly, we're very bullish on the mid and long-term US housing. US housing has been undersupplied by 2 or 3 million units. And at one point, the market will rebalance.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it [higher rates] does [impact our planning]. We actually announced at the same time we announced our dividend program that we would move a little faster than planned to our target 2.5x leverage ratio. And we'll get there by next year from 2.7x and change right now. So you know, we're managing our balance sheet accordingly with the rising cost of interest. But remember, we also are moving into more and more investment grade.\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

                "title": "Hollywood strikes to dampen Big Media's holiday expectations",
                "body": "By Samrhitha A and Chavi Mehta\n\nOct 30 (Reuters) - Big media firms are expected to warn starting this week that studio revenues will slow in the coming quarters as dual Hollywood strikes left them with a thin release slate.\n\nWalt Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount - which together account for nearly half of Hollywood revenues - have delayed the release of films, including \"Dune: Part 2.\"\n\nThat leaves the studios with little to follow the third-quarter success of \"Barbenheimer\", with TD Cowen predicting that box-office revenue in the last three months of the year could be roughly a third lower than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAfter a strong November line up with \"The Marvels,\" \"Trolls Band Together\" and a \"Hunger Games\" prequel, big Christmas releases are few.\n\nThere is no obvious December blockbuster on the scale of \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" the highest-grossing film in 2022, or the 2021 hit \"Spider-Man: No Way Home.\"\n\nThe first dual work stoppage of writers and actors in 63 years has halted most productions since May. While the scribes began returning to work following a 148-day strike after reaching a deal with producers, it remains unclear when the actors would return.\n\nEven if a deal is reached with the actors soon, Wall Street does not expect a quick respite for the studios as it could take weeks for productions to resume.\n\nAnalysts expect studio revenues at Disney and Warner Bros Discovery to slow to 2.9% and 4.7% between October and December, while Paramount will likely post a drop of 1.9%, according to LSEG data.\n\nThat compares with third-quarter estimates for a rise of 4.4% at Disney, 12.5% at Warner Bros Discovery and 16.2% at Paramount.\n\n\"With the major media companies trying very hard to turn the direction of margins back in a positive direction, in part by raising price on OTT services, the potential for an extended dry period for new content carries serious risks,\" TD Cowen said.\n\nThe companies as well as Netflix have raised prices of their streaming services this year, betting that consumers will pay more or opt for cheaper, ad-supported services that are more lucrative for the business.\n\nNetflix, which makes many of its shows and movies overseas, reported earlier this month 9 million estimate-smashing subscriber additions in the September quarter and said it expected similar additions in the holiday period.\n\nHigher fees powered growth in streaming revenue - likely 6.9% at Warner Bros Discovery, 14.2% at Disney and 33% at Paramount - in the September quarter, potentially reducing losses at the money-losing Disney+ and Paramount+ services.\n\nCABLE TV PRESSURE\n\nMedia companies have long been grappling with a decline in cable TV. This has forced Disney to consider the sale of the assets that had long helped subsidize its streaming losses.\n\n\"The only bright spot is ESPN, which is the linchpin that holds the bundle together and viewership has stabilized over the last few years despite accelerated cord-cutting,\" said Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon of Disney, which he said has the largest exposure to traditional cable TV among the major media companies.\n\nDisney has said it will break out sports programming revenue from the holiday quarter, and earlier this month disclosed declining sales and profit at ESPN, for which CEO Bob Iger has signaled he wants to find a partner to help create a streaming service.\n\nDisney is expected to report its fifth straight quarterly decline in linear TV revenue, a fall of 3.8%. Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount are expected to see declines of 5.4% each in their cable TV businesses.\n\nOverall revenue at Disney is expected to rise 6%, Warner Bros Discovery to inch 2.1% higher and Paramount to grow 2.8%.\n\nParamount will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 2, while Disney and Warner Bros Discovery are slated for Nov. 8.

But it isn't becoming of a CM to wreak havoc in people's lives by doing so.\"\n\nShekhawat was responding to Siddaramaiah's accusation that the central government has failed to address water issues.\n\nThe CM had accused the Centre for not addressing Karnataka's water woes despite the state receiving deficit rainfall this year. He also alleged that none of the BJP MPs had raised the issue of water in the state.\n\nSiddaramaiah also alleged that Mekedatu and Mahadayi projects are pending central government's approval. He accused the Centre for the issuance of gazette notification on Upper Krishna Project for north Karnataka's irrigation.\n\n\"Do you want to inflict more thirst on Kannadigas, dear Prime Minister?\" Siddaramaiah had asked Narendra Modi on X.\n\nClarifying the allegations, Shekhawat said: \"You are very well aware of the status of the Mekedatu project. If not, let us remind you, since your briefing team seems to be doing a sorry job. Latest status stands thus: Discussion on the DPR of the Mekedatu project was included as an agenda item during various meetings of Cauvery Water Monitoring Authority.\n\n\"However, discussion on this issue could not take place due to lack of consensus among party states on this agenda item. The Detailed Project Reports of Kalasa and Bhandura scheme Nala have already been approved by the Central Water Commission (CWC) with certain conditions and the same has been communicated to government of Karnataka.\"\n\nHe added: \"Of the 5 projects from Karnataka prioritised under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)- Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme during 2017, three stand completed. Two are ongoing and ₹1,190.05 crore of the ₹1,238.30 crore of Central assistance has already been released to date.\n\n\"Under the Atal Bhujal Yojana, Karnataka has already received ₹629.54 crore from the Centre but spent only ₹274.05 cr as on October 28, 2023.\"\n\nUNI BDN SY CS1403",

                "title": "The wrong type of plumbing can increase the risk of Legionnaires' disease",
                "body": "Researchers at the Norwegian science institute SINTEF have been testing different types of water distribution cabinets. Cabinets that combine the distribution of both domestic tap water and water for floor heating, are now shown to represent an unnecessary risk of Legionnaires' disease.\n\nPipe-in-pipe plumbing systems on the Norwegian market are tested and approved via the SINTEF Technical Approval System. However, plumbing installed in connection with so-called combi-cabinets has not been approved. The reason for this is the risk of establishing the Legionella bacterium that can cause serious lung infection, and which claims the lives of an unknown number of people each year.\n\nThe Legionella bacterium can establish itself in the biofilm that forms on the inside of water pipes, where it can reproduce if conditions are favourable. Once the bacterium has established itself in the plumbing system, it can be difficult to get rid of.\n\n\"A commonly used method is to flush the plumbing system with hot water. Unfortunately, recent research indicates that this has little effect\", says Dag Fredrik Nedberg, who is an adviser at SINTEF Community.\n\nIn a pipe-in-pipe system, it is usually the case that heat transfer takes place between hot and cold water in the distribution cabinet. In order to investigate how different cabinet systems affect the temperature in standing cold water, we have compared the results of field measurements carried out in different types of distribution cabinets.\n\nThe poorest performers are the combi-cabinet systems, in which tap water and water for floor heating are installed side by side in the same cabinet. Not surprisingly, the floor heating system gives off a lot of heat. This causes the temperature in the cabinet to rise to as much as 40 °C, offering the best possible temperature range for establishment of the Legionella bacterium. Tap water is heated rapidly to the same temperature, and if the water remains standing in the system for some days, this will provide excellent growth conditions for the bacterium. Other types of distribution cabinet may also provide favourable conditions for bacterial growth, such as those connected to riser pipes, which are commonly installed in tall buildings.\n\nIn tall buildings, water seldom remains standing in the riser pipes, and there is a constant supply of new hot water that heats up the distribution cabinet. Our measurements showed that this type of cabinet exhibited temperatures of more than 30 °C throughout a 24-hour period, providing ideal conditions for the establishment and growth of the Legionella bacterium. (See the figure below)\n\nThe prevention of bacterial growth is thus all about maintaining the correct temperature conditions in the water pipes. Cold water must be kept at low temperatures, preferably below 20 °C. In practice, this causes complications, because standing water in the plumbing system will soon acquire the same temperature as its surroundings.\n\nAccording to SINTEF, cold water should be kept as cold as possible and never be allowed to become warmer than room temperature, regardless of how long it remains standing in the plumbing system. In order to achieve this, we must ensure that the cold water is not heated by other installations in the building. The best approach is to make sure that systems required to supply hot water are isolated as much as possible from cold water installations.\n\n'Standard' water distribution cabinets, which supply only hot and cold tap water, performed surprisingly well during the SINTEF investigation. Even if the hot water system releases some heat, the temperature in the cabinets remained only a few degrees above room temperature.\n\n\"If we are to completely avoid heat transfer in our tap water systems, the best approach is to install the hot and cold water systems in separate cabinets. However, we believe that standard distribution cabinets accommodating both hot and cold tap water represent an acceptable solution\", says Dag Fredrik Nedberg.",

The yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was barely changed at 5.024%. What's driving markets\n\nMeagre moves in Treasuries early Monday suggested traders were awaiting guidance from a slew of potential catalysts during the week.\n\nIn chronological order, Tuesday will see the latest monetary policy decision from the Bank of Japan, which has the potential to wobble the fixed income market if the central bank makes adjustments to its yield curve control policy.\n\nThen on Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury will deliver its quarterly funding announcement and the Federal Reserve will give an update on monetary policy.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a 96% probability that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at a range of 5.25% to 5.50% after its next meeting on November 1, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThe chances of a 25 basis point rate hike to a range of 5.50 to 5.75% at the subsequent meeting in December is priced at 24%, though that may shift depending on what Fed Cahir Jay Powell says during his post-announcement press conference.\n\nThe Bank of England, on Thursday, is also expected to leave rates unchanged.\n\nThen Friday delivers the big economic datapoint of the week; the October nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nWhat are analysts saying\n\n\"We do not expect the Fed to make any changes to policy, and recent Fedspeak pointing to the tightening effect of higher long-term interest rates reinforces this view. This means the November FOMC meeting is unlikely to be a catalyst in moving yields materially in either direction,\" said economists at Goldman Sachs led by Praveen Korapaty.\n\n\"We expect Treasury to announce $739 billion in private marketable borrowing as part of its quarterly refunding; yield curves could trade with mild flattening/steepening bias depending on the outcome. The recent uptick in risk premium improves the risk/reward to owning U.S. duration, particularly at longer holding periods,\" the team at Goldman Sachs added.",

This is particularly evident in the enduring partnership between Indonesia and Malaysia, which stands as a noteworthy example of the effectiveness of collaborative efforts in the realm of global politics. At the core of this steadfast bilateral relationship lies a powerful and ever-evolving economic alliance. This economic partnership serves as a foundation upon which both nations have built a harmonious and mutually beneficial connection. As this economic alliance continues to thrive and adapt, it brings about a tangible enhancement in the quality of life for the citizens of both Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nThe bilateral relationship between Malaysia and Indonesia is rooted in shared history, cultural ties, and a history of colonial rule. While they faced tensions during the Konfrontasi period over the formation of Malaysia, both nations have since fostered cooperation. They were instrumental in founding the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and their economic relations have thrived. Occasional disputes, including territorial issues and concerns over Indonesian migrant workers, have arisen but haven't overshadowed their commitment to maintaining a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship. These nations share more than just geographical proximity; they share a rich cultural tapestry that transcends borders. This shared heritage and proximity have laid the foundation for economic collaboration that has thrived over the years.\n\nThe present state of economic relations between Indonesia and Malaysia is marked by a continued commitment to enhance cooperation across various sectors, creating a positive impact on both nations. This economic partnership, characterized by trade, investment, and collaborative projects, continues to strengthen their ties. In 2022, Indonesia and Malaysia sustained a strong trade partnership, surpassing $27 billion in bilateral trade. This underscores their economic interdependence, with key commodities including palm oil, electronics, machinery, and petroleum products. Additionally, both nations express a willingness to enhance trade, illustrated by initiatives like the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT), fostering economic growth and integration along their borders.\n\nRecent projects in the realm of infrastructure development highlight the commitment of both nations to elevate their economic relations. One such project is the Kuala Tanjung Industrial Park in North Sumatra, Indonesia. This industrial complex, developed with Malaysian investment, aims to bolster trade and economic growth in the region by enhancing transportation and logistics capabilities.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia, renowned as significant palm oil producers, have taken proactive steps towards promoting sustainable palm oil practices. Noteworthy among these efforts are the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) and the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification programmes. These initiatives underscore the commitment of both countries to align their palm oil production with rigorous international sustainability standards, a move aimed at elevating their global competitiveness in the palm oil industry.\n\nThe economic partnership between Indonesia and Malaysia faces challenges stemming from trade disputes, especially in the palm oil sector. These disputes can strain relations and impact economic cooperation. Labor migration issues have also caused disagreements, necessitating solutions that safeguard the rights of Indonesian workers in Malaysia. Both nations grapple with infrastructure gaps and environmental concerns in the palm oil industry.\n\nThe bilateral relationship between Malaysia and Indonesia encounters challenges, including territorial and maritime disputes, trade tensions, labor migration issues, historical sensitivities, and political differences. While these challenges can create periodic tensions, both countries recognize the importance of their relationship and continue to engage in diplomatic efforts to find common ground and foster cooperation in various sectors. In 2020, both nations successfully settled a longstanding border dispute in the Ambalat region, ultimately leading to increased collaboration in offshore resource exploration. Additionally, maritime boundary conflicts in the Sulawesi Sea were addressed through diplomatic negotiations in 2021, allowing for more harmonious interactions in the shared waters. Recently, in early 2023, during President Joko Widodo's visit to Malaysia, two significant agreements were reached regarding the delineation of their territorial waters in specific sections of the Straits of Malacca and the Sulawesi Sea. Furthermore, both nations committed to addressing additional land boundary disputes with the goal of resolution by June 2024. These instances underscore the positive outcomes achievable when disputes are amicably resolved, ultimately creating a conducive environment for enhanced cooperation and shared prosperity between Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nThe potential for expansion can be found in broadening trade horizons, extending beyond the palm oil sector, and venturing into collaborative infrastructure ventures. Focusing on sustainability measures and complying with certification norms in the palm oil industry can help address environmental apprehensions while ensuring continued market reach. Concurrently, shared efforts in research and development and an influential role within the ASEAN region offer room for innovation and economic amalgamation, thereby reinforcing the economic alliance between Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nTheir enduring partnership, rooted in a robust and dynamic economic alliance, highlights their exceptional ability to align their interests and translate them into meaningful actions that not only benefit both nations but also hold far-reaching implications. As they continue to fortify their trade networks, invest in each other's economies, and engage in transformative infrastructure projects, Indonesia and Malaysia are not only poised for remarkable economic growth but also positioned as drivers of regional stability and progress in Southeast Asia. Their unwavering commitment to nurturing economic interdependence and fostering innovation not only assures their collective success but also offers an inspiring model for other nations aspiring to build enduring and mutually enriching relationships in the intricate realm of international diplomacy. With economic cooperation as their cornerstone, the future of Indonesia-Malaysia bilateral relations shines with the promise of even greater economic prosperity and shared well-being.",

It looked at exports both to the EU and the rest of the world (ROW) and found that the latter stayed steady while the former fell.\n\nThe study -- reported by The Guardian and Bloomberg -- said that small businesses that account for much of the trade in the sector have been \"disproportionately damaged\" by new post-Brexit trade barriers, as well as by changes to rules around EU workers in Britain causing a skills shortage.\n\nWhile Covid also had an impact, there was a clear divergence between EU and ROW exports even when the pandemic's effects were taken into account.\n\nUK exports of cosmetics and personal care products to the EU rose between 2010 and Brexit vote year 2016 but have declined ever since.\n\nThe Council's CEO Millie Kendall told Bloomberg that \"Covid is not the problem, Brexit is the problem. People have pulled out of territories.\"\n\nThe study follows a British Chambers of Commerce report just a few days ago that found almost half of UK exporters struggling with the changes needed to keep exporting under the UK-EU trade deal.\n\nCopyright © 2023 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved.\n\nTags : Beauty Perfume Cosmetics Aesthetics Wellness Hair Miscellaneous Business",

A subsequent rise in yields may further pressure stocks.\n\nWith inflation gradually easing in the United States, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of its policy meeting on Nov. 1, according to the CME Group's Fedwatch tool.\n\nHowever, certain parts of the economy have proved to be resilient, spurring concerns that the central bank could signal willingness to hold rates at their current level for longer than previously anticipated.\n\nA fresh batch of data on the U.S. economy this week, ending with the October's non-farm payrolls report on Friday, will be on the watchlist for further cues on the Fed's monetary policy path.\n\nInvestors also await quarterly results from companies including McDonald's, Apple, Pfizer and Eli Lilly, with the third-quarter earnings season having reached the halfway point.\n\nAt 5:22 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 178 points, or 0.55%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 29 points, or 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 123.5 points, or 0.87%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Coherus Biosciences jumped 15.2% in premarket trade as the U.S. health regulator approved the company's treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer.

                "body": "By Stefano Rebaudo\n\nOct 30 (Reuters) - Euro area sovereign bond yields edged lower on Monday, with investors reckoning markets broadly priced in a higher-for-longer outlook for policy rates while new data confirmed inflation in Germany was falling.\n\nGermany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was down 3 basis points (bps) at 2.81%. In early October, it hit 3.024%, its highest level in 12 years.\n\nCiti analysts said in a note to clients that their \"Bund yield forecasts adopt a neutral stance near-term with a frontloaded rally in 2024.\"\n\nThey also flagged an \"end-cycle tendency for the market to underprice subsequent (policy rate) cuts.\"\n\nMoney markets are currently pricing zero chance of a rate hike by-year-end and cuts in 2024.\n\nLong-dated yields rose sharply in the last few weeks in a U.S. Treasury-led bond selloff as markets adjusted their positioning to a higher for longer rate outlook and an increase of the so-called term premium - the excess return an investor requires for holding a longer-term bond over short-term investments. Bond prices move inversely with yields.\n\nInflation eased in October in Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia pointing to a substantial cooling in headline inflation in the euro zone's largest economy.\n\nThe German state of Brandenburg released data on Friday.\n\nSpain's 12-month inflation in October was unchanged from the previous month at 3.5%.\n\n\"Favourable base effects in the first half of this year helped to lower headline inflation sharply,\" said Wouter Thierie, economist at ING.\n\n\"Since early summer, we have entered a new phase where favourable base effects play less strongly, allowing headline inflation to pick up again,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's economy shrank slightly in the third quarter, data showed on Monday.\n\nInvestors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve policy meeting due late on Wednesday, while there is a large consensus the cooling inflation is likely to keep the U.S. central bank on pause in coming months. Traders still price in no chance the Fed will lift its policy rate from the current 5.25%-5.5% range.\n\nItaly's 10-year yields, the benchmark for the euro area's periphery, dropped 7.5 bps to 4.73%.\n\nThe gap between Italian and German 10-year yields -- a gauge of the risk premium investors ask to hold debt of the euro zone's most indebted countries -- dropped to 192 bps, its tightest level in around a week.\n\nFurthermore, fears about the conflict in the Middle East supported the appetite for safe-haven sovereign bonds.\n\nStocks were mixed on Monday as Israel's push into Gaza stirred fears of a wider conflict.\n\n(Reporting by Stefano Rebaudo, editing by Angus MacSwan) ;))",

                "title": "Palm Springs Puts Temporary Hold on New Cannabis Licenses | High Times",
                "body": "The Palm Springs City Council voted last week to put a temporary moratorium on issuing new cannabis licenses while civic leaders consider steps to rein in the growth of the regulated weed industry. The council voted 4-0 to issue the 45-day moratorium, with Councilmember Christy Holstege recusing herself from the vote because her husband has business ties to the cannabis industry.\n\nPalm Springs, a city in the southern California desert with nearly 46,000 residents, has issued 33 licenses for cannabis retailers to operate in its jurisdiction, at least 27 of which are operational. The city thus has one dispensary for every 1,700 residents, a saturation of weed shops that is reportedly the highest in the Coachella Valley and one of the highest statewide.\n\nThe proliferation of pot dispensaries in Palm Springs has prompted some city leaders and cannabis business owners to call for steps to control the growth of the industry. Prior to Thursday's meeting, city staff told the council that several policy options were up for discussion. Recommendations to the city council include capping the number of dispensary licenses at 15, although it is unclear how such a limit would affect current license holders.\n\nCity staff also recommended limiting owners to one dispensary in the city, banning the sale or transfer of existing cannabis licenses and cutting the city's cannabis taxes, which are among the highest in the Coachella Valley. A report provided to the council showed that the city's cannabis tax revenues declined for the second fiscal year in a row. Average sales per dispensary in the city of Palm Springs have also dropped. Cannabis taxes in other cities in the Coachella Valley have also been declining, according to the report.\n\nCity staff also recommended putting a 45-day moratorium on issuing new dispensary licenses while the council considered the recommendations.\n\n\"I just want everyone to know this isn't a ban. This is simply a pause,\" Veronica Goedhart, the director of special program compliance for Palm Springs, told the council prior to Thursday's vote. \"A pause for us to sit back, take a look at the current regulations, the current market conditions, and try to make it better for the future.\"\n\n\"We do have an oversaturation of retail businesses in Palm Springs. Our city is not very large, and we have the largest number of dispensaries in the Coachella Valley per capita,\" Goedhart added. \"The industry is facing a lot of challenges with taxes, and then the competition with the oversaturation. so we really want to revisit what we can do to prevent the industry from collapsing.\"\n\nAs the city council discussed the recommendations, Councilmembers Jeffrey Bernstein and Lisa Middleton appeared to be in favor of taking steps to limit the number of dispensaries in Palm Springs, according to media reports. Mayor Grace Garner and Councilmember Ron deHarte seemed unsure about the prospect. In addition to declining to vote, Holstege recused herself from the discussion on the issue.\n\nBernstein said that he supported the cap on dispensaries because of a spike in commercial rents in areas where dispensaries are allowed. This has led longtime business owners to lose their leases, only to see the new pot shop quickly fail because of market oversaturation. Bernstein also said he believes that the city has harmed the nascent regulated cannabis industry by allowing it to grow too quickly.\n\nMiddleton also expressed concern about the cannabis industry's effect on the real estate market in Palm Springs, agreeing that many of the existing weed shops will likely eventually fail. She was not convinced that the city's pot taxes are too high, saying that oversaturation in the retail market was more likely responsible for its ills.\n\n\"What we're seeing is city after city trying to cut their taxes significantly in order to save an industry that is just simply overpopulated with distribution points,\" said Middleton.\n\nThe mayor asked city staff to analyze if the number of dispensaries is more than what is needed to serve the number of visitors to Palm Springs.\n\n\"I understand we have oversaturation in relation to our population,\" said Garner, \"but are we oversaturated in terms of the tourist economy we have?\"\n\nGarner also said that if the city council does decide to limit the number of cannabis licenses in Palm Springs, it should ensure that the changes allow for a diverse mix of businesses, including onsite consumption lounges. The mayor added that doing so would be necessary to accommodate the tourists who make up much of the local cannabis industry's clientele.\n\nThe council decided only to enact the 45-day pause on new licenses during its meeting on October 26 while the other recommendations are considered. The moratorium currently is scheduled to end on December 10. The city council could extend the end during its next meeting, however, to give city staff more time to return with more data and new recommendations.",

                "body": "A FORGOTTEN Liverpool flop is hoping to salvage his Anfield career with a loan spell with Gerard Pique's FC Andorra.\n\nThat's despite being at the Merseyside club for almost SIX years without making a single appearance.\n\nAnderson Arroyo, 24, is a defender who hails from Colombia.\n\nAble to play at centre-back or right-back, he was snapped up by Liverpool from Fortaleza CEIF in February 2018.\n\nArroyo was immediately loaned to Spanish side Mallorca for 18 months in the hope of securing a British work permit.\n\nBut he never played for the seniors, featuring just 14 times for Mallorca's B team before his loan was cut short.\n\nArroyo has since embarked on a further five temporary moves in order to gain his work permit.\n\nAnd he made it six when he signed with FC Andorra in July.\n\nThe minnows were bought by Barcelona legend and ex-Man Utd star Pique in 2018.\n\nArroyo has since played eight times for his latest club.\n\nFREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS\n\nAnd he hopes he can finally earn the post-Brexit work permit needed to feature for Liverpool.\n\nIndeed, Klopp could yet have plans for Arroyo after handing him a new contract last year.\n\nThe ace needs to bag 15 \"eligibility points\" to be able to play in England.\n\nThese are acquired by club minutes, the quality of the league and senior international appearances.\n\nAnd Arroyo will have to bank on playing a full season for FC Andorra in order to achieve his dream.\n\nBut he can take heart from Chelsea's Andrey Santos, who was denied a work permit when he joined the Blues from Vasco de Gama in January.\n\nThe midfielder returned to his old side on loan before securing his work permit via the international route.\n\nSantos led Brazil's U20s to the World Cup before earning a single senior cap.\n\nAnd it was enough for Chelsea to finally register him before deciding to loan Santos to fellow Premier League side Nottingham Forest.",

                "title": "An In-Depth Look at Portman Industrial's Speculative Philly Campus",
                "body": "John Gaskin reveals details about I-76 Trade Center, the massive project coming online in one of the most sought-after areas for industrial development.\n\nPhiladelphia remains one of industrial developers' favorite locations in the Northeast, with the metro accounting for the largest under-construction pipeline as of August -- 16.8 million square feet or 3.9 percent of existing inventory -- according to a recent CommercialEdge report. Banking on the area's stable fundamentals and the growing demand for modern facilities, many developers are starting construction on new projects on a speculative basis.\n\nRecently, site work began at Portman Industrial's I-76 Trade Center, a $330 million speculative project totaling 1.9 million square feet in Exton, Pa. The logistics campus is slated to encompass three facilities that will come online in two phases. The first one is set to bring to the market a 636,120-square-foot, cross-dock building with four drive-in doors, 110 dock doors, 146 trailer stalls and 508 parking spaces, while Phase II will include a 1.1 million-square-foot facility and another 154,440-square-foot building.\n\nBuilt on almost 170 acres, I-76 Trade Center is slated for full completion in early 2025. Commercial Property Executive asked Portman Industrial Managing Director John Gaskin to share details about how work at the massive project is going and expand on the area's growth potential.\n\nWhat convinced you to invest in Philadelphia?\n\nGaskin: Philadelphia has the oldest industrial inventory in the country. The existing stock of product does not have the modern amenities and building features it needs to support current demand. Now, we are seeing a more robust pipeline of advanced industrial space -- such as more efficient dock doors and taller ceilings. With I-76 Trade Center, we are developing a three-building, institutional-quality logistics campus that will answer the demand for modern warehouse and logistics space in this region.\n\nThis region benefits from being in close proximity to major metros, including New York City and Washington, D.C. Philadelphia is the seventh-largest MSA in the country. With a strong trajectory for future growth, Southeastern Pennsylvania is an economic engine, supported by a wide network of expressways, trains and buses.\n\nREAD ALSO: Industrial Sector Navigates Growth Challenges\n\nWhat sets the I-76 Trade Center project apart from other industrial developments in the metro?\n\nGaskin: I-76 Trade Center's premier location sets it apart from other projects. With frontage along the Pennsylvania Turnpike, it is situated strategically within Philadelphia's western suburbs and provides immediate access to Exit 312. The Interstate 76 Schuylkill Expressway, the Interstate 95 Delaware Expressway, Interstate 476, and U.S. routes 202, 100 and 30 all contribute to the region's long-term logistics prowess. Additionally, I-76 Trade Center is equidistant to Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike.\n\nOverall, the area benefits from impressive logistical infrastructure, including the Philadelphia International Airport, Port of Philadelphia and three intermodal rail centers, as well as FedEx and UPS facilities.\n\nPhase I is scheduled for delivery next year in August. What types of businesses do you envision as the ideal fit for the facility?\n\nGaskin: When starting a project like this, it's easy to think that the obvious end user is a tenant focused on warehousing and the distribution of consumer goods. However, as we have developed this type of product over the past few years, we have been successful in attracting a variety of tenants.\n\nSince we are developing the I-76 Trade Center on a speculative basis, it creates the opportunity for the tenant to come from any sector. In addition to warehousing and distribution, the end users could be involved in manufacturing, life sciences, data centers or cold storage. The product we are building is going to be attractive to all types of users.\n\nGiven the current economic climate, securing funding for a project of this magnitude can be challenging. Were there any obstacles in obtaining funding for the development?\n\nGaskin: These are turbulent times for capital markets. At Portman, we benefit from a 70-year track record of doing these types of projects with fantastic equity partners. We are fortunate to have deep, long-term banking relationships that allow us to fully capitalize our projects even when the industry is facing economic headwinds.\n\nThere's a growing trend for developers to add recreational facilities and other amenities to industrial projects. Will I-76 Trade Center feature such spaces?\n\nGaskin: At I-76 Trade Center, we are building a 26-acre public park with walking trails and other amenities. We are also preserving historical farming facilities on the site. Since we are building spec, we will defer to the tenant on the specific amenities they would want included for the building, such as a basketball court, outdoor seating, etc.\n\nREAD ALSO: A Backstage Look at Hines' Quantum 56 Project in Denver\n\nTo what extent has Portman incorporated community considerations into the planning and execution of I-76 Trade Center?\n\nGaskin: We are passionate about contributing to the communities we are in, and our philosophy is always to listen first. When we set our eyes on a project, we place a huge emphasis on being open and transparent with the community about our plans. We are dedicated to meeting with the neighborhood and community groups and really taking the time to get their input.\n\nFor example, at I-76 Trade Center, we listened to the township and community members and knew it was important to incorporate a public park, as well as preserve the historic farming buildings.\n\nWhat are the most frequent challenges industrial developers need to face today? How is Portman addressing these headwinds?\n\nGaskin: In our industry today, there are short-term and long-term headwinds. Currently, the short-term headwinds are the challenges with the capital markets in raising equity and debt. As inflation eases and interest rates decline, we fully expect that the capital will start flowing back into the industrial development sector.\n\nThe long-term headwinds that we are facing include dysfunction in the supply chain, longer and unpredictable entitlement periods, labor shortages and product availability -- like switchgear, generators and fire pumps. In this regard, it is critically important to do your homework and plan accordingly.\n\nWhat emerging technologies is Portman monitoring or actively incorporating into its development strategies?\n\nGaskin: Our team and the industry as a whole is laser-focused on how to achieve greater energy efficiency within industrial buildings. We are looking at innovative ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment and lower operating costs. There is a considerable effort being placed on bringing alternative sources of power into these facilities, and this is something we will continue to prioritize for a more sustainable future.\n\nSpeaking of the future...we're nearing the end of 2023. Is there a particular trends that you expect to shape the industrial market in the upcoming year?\n\nGaskin: While things have slowed down, leasing activity remains rock solid. There continues to be significant levels of new tenants and deals in the market. Now more than ever, tenants are doing a very careful analysis to find the right location. Companies are taking a hard look at the available space and analyzing if that area is sustainable for fulfilling labor needs, operating costs and more.",
